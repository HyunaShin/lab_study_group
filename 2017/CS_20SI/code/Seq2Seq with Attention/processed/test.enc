How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
She's not a...
Have fun tonight?
The "real you".
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
What's normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Never
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Number one.  She hates smokers
What 're you talking about?
Sure
She kissed me.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I'm on it
What?
Hey.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
This is so patronizing.
Unwelcome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
So what's your excuse?
Wait I...
It wasn't like that.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Because I like to torture you.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
Right.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
You were right. She's still pissed.
I missed you.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
What's to discuss?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
What does he say?
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Father Marchena!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
How long?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
What's he doing?
Six days ago, yes.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
What about Oleg?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
I will if they don't send me back.
So...the station is empty?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
What are you doing?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
I let her take a shower.
End my career?
Where is she?
Any I.D.?
Only one guys checked in?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
What are you saying?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
You got any better ideas?
I'm on duty.
Yeah.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Promise?
Tonight.
You promise?
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
How old are your kids?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
And what do you do with the bones?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Don't fool around.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Speak English!
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
I speak English.
New York.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
CONTINUED
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Yes, it is.
CONTINUED
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
And your charming little daughter?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Certainly.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
What do you mean?
I will if I can, Frank.
Five by five, Frank.
Roger.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Yeah.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I ain't tired yet.
I'm candy...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
You here to write my life story?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Thank you.
What do you think?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
There.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Where's the money?
Right, partner.
Where's the goddamn car?
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
We missed.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Do I get to kiss her too?
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Partnership?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Jack, are you okay?
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Hi, it's me...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
How ya doin'?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
You chickenshit punk...
How about some ammo?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Where's Leeloo?
I don't have time... I need to know.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Ma???
You know how to fly this thing?
Just one... why me?
And the third one?
Don't you open your messages?
You hear that?
Cornelius..
You know women normally change five times more than men.
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
Exactly.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
It's not?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Got it.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
I know.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Don't...
Mrs. Christian.
Bullshit.
A fellow investor.
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
What the fuck are you.. ?
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Easy enough for you.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
You almost went over your limit.
Big date tonight?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much do you make now?
Sounds good, pops.
Child pornography.
Snuff films.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
He's odd.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
I told you I can't, not yet.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're joking.
I'm here.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
She just seemed... depressed... ?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
No.
I don't know.  I think so.
Will you let me look?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
No...
I can't go back to sleep again.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
You're his sister, right?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Not really.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Where are we going?
How was the meeting?
You disappointed in me?
Alice!
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I thought about that.
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
They think I'm nuts.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Who?
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Reef!
We're stuck tight!
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
You hear that?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
That's a <u>face</u>???
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
What are you boys up to?
How soon?
I hear Twombley got shot.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
You can't buy Wade off.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I don't want to.
It's fun.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I called Mommy.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Are we going in this?
How about a Big Mac?
No.
How you holding up, Wade?
I won't. You interested?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
It's just...
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Call me.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Money.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
How?
Can --?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
Something about my father?
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Yeah.
Love! I'm made of love!
You think Jack shot him?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Which is?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Yeah.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Your father never means to be so...
Mom?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
They aren't answering their hails.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
That's affirmative.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
A dubious distinction, no?
And all these rooms here?
*                     Please tell me your name.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Now, or he dies, please.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Jim...
Stop.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Can't it wait?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
What?
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
Someone should give you a raise.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Yeah, right.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
WE'RE HOOKED!
That just doesn't make any sense.
Did you feel that?
Yes I did...
Who's that, Ted?
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I'd use the word insane.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
That's not possible.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
All right.  Here.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
You folks need any help?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Both pilots!
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
A hospital? What is it?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
What did he have?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Good-bye, darling.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Roger.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
That's right.
William Harcourt?
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Here?
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
To the... to the beach?
Please, I must get out here.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
Yes.  That follows.
I'll go.
Have they located my daughter yet?
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
You son of a bitch.
What's he scanning for?
I told them to fall back...
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
They cut the power.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Why not?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Did you ever have a baby?
Don't go!  Please.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
That's right.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
No, she's fine.
Hardly.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Now?
Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
No!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Well, don't do that again!
No!
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Who was that?
He's terribly busy, sir.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
It is miraculous.
Alone.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
Money! Money!
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
May I try it?
Sire.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Why are you here?
Do you always live like this?
Why not?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Are you Herr Mozart?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
No.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What for?
Love, Sire!
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Did my work please you?
You flatter me.
What work?
What dead? Who is dead?
Who are you?
You mean she's not coming back?
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Finish what?
What?
Strange!
We ended in F Major?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Exactly.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
What is what?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Leave me alone.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Do you hear me?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I poisoned his life.
Are you absolutely sure?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
I agree, Baron.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Of course.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
Yes, Doctor?
What happened to them?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
He's here.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
You're a very beautiful girl.
I'm twenty-seven.
Now what do you want to talk about?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Are you better now?
Charming.
Lovely.
It's nice to see you.
Of course.
Anything.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I should be committed.
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Feeling better?
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Who is this girl?
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
Hello.
Nice looking group.
What about it?
What the hell was that all about?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Did you hear that?
Could be a lot of things.
No, but he was on the moors.
Plan?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Shut up, you zombie!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Get out of here, Jack!
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
Where's Matt?
He has?
It was more than that last week.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Charlie!
I remember once when your account checked.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
What about?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Say, you can't do that
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Me?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
No.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
John, how's your wife this morning?
Yes.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Longer.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Mine too?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Is it safe?
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Yes.
No.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
What's keeping you?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
How?
I'm sorry, Cole.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What you sayin' boy?
What is wrong with you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Sorry.
Yep.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Which one, right or left?
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
You're right, sir.
Web died fighting?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Mm-hmm.
Hell of a war.
You can shut up now.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Jesse, we're outlaws.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Riders --
But still died.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
A river pirate.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Let me see that.
Don't turn around.
Yes ma'am.
Did you order our houses burned down?
That's what I would have done.
Now let's have a drink.
Right here in church?
Well, not exactly.
... too young for whisky...
Why, yeah.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
Lyla Devereux.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
How can that be?
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Yes sir.
THEN WHO DID?!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Can you put men at all four?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes.
Pull out, goddamnit!
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.
Carnes? Wait.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please, Patrick.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
When?
I'll do it.
Anywhere you want?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Jean? What?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Well.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matine of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Where did you go to school?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Bad habit.
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Oh.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
I checked it out. It's clean.
I'm so hungry.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Oh well, you know.
Is that a raincoat?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Teddy was killed last night.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
My goodness.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
...Hello?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
You've been coming in early.
Gary, hi.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
That's great! Thanks.
Gary, I --
I think you should go.
Just thought his work should go on.
You know mine.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
What about the FBI?
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
What?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Does he know you know?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Meet me at the other location.
Maybe it's the satellite.
What?
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
Did you tell Alice?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Speaking of which...
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
You may.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Or sometimes not at all.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
Hey, how are you?
We know all that, Exposition.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Thank you, Exposition.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
My mother's told me all about you.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Fancy a nibble?
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
No, did you use a condom?
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'll hurry back.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
Lay it on me.
That's not mine.
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Quite impressive.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Great.
How's Austin?
What do you want to do, Scott?
Red ...
Promised? Who promised?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
An unholy trinity ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
But -- why?
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Did he say who?
Any ideas?
Is that written in his shoe?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Do you always drive this fast?
Barely.
I could save you the trouble.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
You lied.
Aren't you coming?
Have you any place in mind?
You don't believe him?
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
I see.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Why?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
You with Mother or Father?
I was at Harrow ...
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Huh? Wha...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
A real turd.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
That's it, prick lips.
Why?
Let's go.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I'll take some.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Ha, ha, ha.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Are any of those right?
It's on the tenth floor.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
You've been having strange sex...!
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
I don't know.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Debbie.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Yeah...
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Jennifer.
Thanks for calling.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Hi.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
I have a job.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
I was ahead of my time.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Firehouse.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Investigator Rimgale.
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
Me?
I forgive you.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
He gots to be did.
You truly are a dancing fool.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Delacroix.
What are you talkin' about?
Good morning, Cheeba.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
We think so.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Manray!
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
Who's side are you on?
A gift.
I don't want to hear it.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
Light?
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Not her, the one with the little...
No, not that.  How 'bout...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...like grits and butter...
You slept too near where you got in?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
And what?
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
And his baggage?
And so I am.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Good gracious!  What is this?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
That is a trifle strong.
Not even that.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
You want my heart?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Yes, of course.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, my little darling.
I beg your pardon?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Charming Schuvaloff.
He is only curious to know who you are.
He loves me, as I love you.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
What do we do?
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
How do you know that?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Jesus, what happened?
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Roberto, what the fuck?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
Look in my pack.
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
I didn't --
And the problem is you only got three.
Who killed Pike?
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Nevertheless --
Tom, where are you going --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Move him.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
I didn't shoot West...
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Are you sure?
You wanted to break him.
Yeah.
So what now?
Do I have a choice in this?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Nah.
We just want --
Wrong answer --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
See! The big guy likes it.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
I have to leave. Tonight.
Why?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
You don't like it?
Okay.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Did you do any of that?
You think I'm up for it?
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
You know where the chemicals are?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
What?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I'm sorry.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
That really happened?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
What?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Yes. I know.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
No.
So?
So how long will you be in England?
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
Tell me what he said.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
What did he say? Tell me!
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
Oh Jesus.
Is that everything?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
I don't want to know.
In every sense. If at all possible.
So uh...
Excuse me?
No.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
No.
What happened between you and the blonde?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
What was her name?
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
Something else.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Lazarus?
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
When? Now? Oh. No.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Let go of my arm...
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Two days?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
No ma'am.
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
What I love.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Ain't gonna be moved?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Rae don't do this now...
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Are you wasted?
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
What's this?
Nick, we can't just --
This the right place?
Getting very weird.
You cool, Ich?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
What...?  Why?
Nick, you can't do this.
She ever pull down her shades?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
What do you chant?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
What if I chant?
One guy do all the damage?
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
We're police officers.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
You had my help, detective.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
He could?
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
When do you deliver your project?
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Industrial refuse.
She was gonna get away.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Why, yes, of course.
How do I stop one?
But I would like to buy you drink.
How long you had these guys?
Sorry.
Too old.
It that mother real?
The best.
Why not?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Who is this?
Did you cry when your father died?
Like?
This feels stupid.
You mean a woman?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
If she is, the machine works.
Discreetly.
Know what a turtle is?
But I understand what you mean.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
You want to go home?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Hi!
You're kidding!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
How do you do?
My office.
Please excuse this interruption.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Are you French?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
I just had a mental picture of...
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Wait!  Wait!
Why are you doing that?
I haven't brushed yet.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
See, ya.
...Okay.
What's the pay?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Then forget it.
Why?!
It does?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Of course.
Thank-Q!
May I please be excused?
The guy with the underpants!
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I'm really sorry!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
I've got to go, now.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Then why go there?
...the pipe tobacco.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Almost all of them.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
Twenty-five? Around there.
Elbows, Son.
Sorry, Mom!
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Are you in trouble, son?!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Really?
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
You hear that?!
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
How long will we have to stay down here?
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
What?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Yes.
Well, I am the head of this household--
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Stop it, you two!
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Um... Eve?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Yes, you do!
What?
Oh, no!
And if we can't find him?
Yeah! That's thinking.
Tower, say again!!
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
No.
Come in.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I guess I should go.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
Bull.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Where are we going, Frank?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
What are you lookin' at?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
What?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
God, you scared me.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
Well.
Hi Dad.
Uh-uh.
Good to see you, son.
Oh yeah?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Okay, thanks.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Did you see her undressed?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You want to go talk to him?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead.
Stop it Mike.
Hey, I just...
Lord's name.
Yes sir.
Where's your gun?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
You think they sold me out? No way.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
No ma! No!
We're alive.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Hey Murphy?
Aye.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
I don't know they just always need it.
Where the fuck are you going?
Give the guy a shot.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Where's my cat?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Fuck you!
Roc. You okay?
Hello? You there?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
She's really kind of hot.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I heard that.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
What's wrong with him?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
When'd he tell you?
Where was I?
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm not. But there's --
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
What is it?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
He was a nice guy.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Good. It's supposed to be.
Nobody move!
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
So how is it in there? 
That's a sharp jacket.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
You mean a safecracker?
How does that feel?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Hector woudn't do anything.
Could you grow cinnamon?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
How do you say nineteen?
Were you born in Mexico?
You're Anthony?
What?
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
That never would of --
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
OK, Bob.
Bob.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
He electrocuted someone?
Bob. Are you coming?
Come on, Dignan.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Bob, you're lying!
Come on!
I'm sorry, Bob.
Come on, Bob.
Scarecrow?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Here we go.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
26 weeks.
Why?
He left his sweater.
You a good pool player.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
And the Landy woman?
Save it for Bourne.
Treadstone.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Jesus...
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
You're a liar.
I have to go now.
Try again.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
It's just a nightmare.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
But we were so careful.
So...
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
Where --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Where are you going?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I wanted to kill him.
But you found another choice.
You do?
See that tram coming around the corner?
Yes.
Why is she trying to kill me?
What is this, a game?
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
Abbott?
My first job.
Where am I?
Why am I alive?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Alright... take it down.
What?
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
This is everything? Is there.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
You mean, did I want a date?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
We must sue for peace.
So let the council swear publicly.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Wallace's followers.
The little cow is insane --
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
You know it's a trap.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
They're coming!
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
No. He did not.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
I do not confess.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Nor I!
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
And I with you. But you must wake.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
They've tricked us.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
But you must have something to go on?
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Yes.
Are you hurting her?
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Where are my goddamn books?
I thought you were a December baby.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
Are you okay?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
What time is it?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Smells like sex in here.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
My husband is with me, too.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Does he know that?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks, Carl.
Goodnight.
Er, good luck, yes.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
It's not for sale.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
And the other alternative?
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Please.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No.
And then?
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
No.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Are you ready Ilsa?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Your work.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
What of it?
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
Well, this might come in handy.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Everything in order?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Hello, Louis.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
It was a combination of all three.
What, again?
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
The winning side would have paid you much better.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
You're late.
I have the letters right here.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Will I see you tonight?
Are my eyes really brown?
Put that phone down!
He'll double what I pay you.
You ever going to bed?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
No, I don't.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
You've had today's water.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Take it.
It's real.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
I had it on the island with me.
There isn't any us.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
What's that, written on the sail?
Yeah?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
It means a lot...that you came.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Yes, yes he did.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I beat the odds!
What?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
He'll need clothes... some money...
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Dr. Homer Wells.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What's she so emotional about?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
I better go.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Please don't make me say it again.
"...did." Well, okay.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
They wanted a girl.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
No. She was an immigrant.
What kind of plane are you flying?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
First pregnancy?
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
Nobody's named this one yet.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Rose Rose?
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
That's it.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
They told me I was too old to serve.
It look nicer then home!
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Where do you think you're going?
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
But there were other factors.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Guess so.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
We'll take care of it.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
Jake...
Moonan. Here. Shit...
I told you, use less powder.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Jake --
Because you killed one of my crew.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
What about... The money?
What about Customs?
You're just going to have to trust me.
Uh-huh.
Lighten up.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
We're working for the King.
What do we need another Shill for?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Him.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Eee Oott Auught!
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Did he buy it?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
You trust this Moonan guy?
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Habib?
I get it.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
I've got something to tell you.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
I hope it brings you luck.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
What?
I've lived there.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
Near the casino.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Who's they?
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Let it go.
I'm Lucy.
Where to?
You're talking about complicity.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Why four? And not three or five?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Ever?
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
How?
What's he doin'?
It didn't go off.
Thanks.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
That's it.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
What?
TALBY!
I need a diameter approximation.
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
What happened, Doolittle?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
What're you talkin' about?
That's a lotta crap.
What the hell are you doing?
But I'm afraid of--
Which is none of your business...or mine.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
You're light a deuce.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Bent.
Yes on all counts.
The other one like you...
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
I don't know what to say.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Any idea when she'll be back?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Thank you.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Straight.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
A fog bank.
Make the call.
She's got my word.
Tell everybody hey.
Catch you back at the wall.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Really?
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
I was on call. 
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
No, I mean... you love your son?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Namely?
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Whoa... she just farted.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
What the fuck!
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Could be.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Jam, listen up.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Theoretically.
When can I squeeze one out?
I didn't say shit.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
How much longer is this gonna last?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
How old is Grandma Death?
Hey...
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Where are we going?
Well...
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
So, we call them... IMGs.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Why? Is this about the book?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Why should we care?
He said to follow him.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I asked you about school.
What else do you think about during school?
Who is the boss?
Four times... so far.
Nothing.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Because I'm so horny.
God exists because you're horny.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Because you tell Mom everything.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Kitty...
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Really, Loretta?
This came for you, sweetie.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Huh?
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
C'mere. I love you so much.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
This here's Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
Dakota.
Wisconsin.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Well - what is he now?
That was for you.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
What other job you got?
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
You told it to me.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Give me that again!
Then it's war?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
What'll I do with this card?
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Yes please, two.
They have noble faces.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
More romances for John?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
What is it?
What are you going to do?
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
Well, yes.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
How are you feeling today?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Oh no, my friend...
Thank you very much.
The main spire.
I'll have to find some more.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Mmmerrick.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
How is your tea, John?
Not at all, John.
The Children. Where are your children
Good morning, John.
Good morning.
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Yes. John wants it.
HE'S GONE!
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Ah! It's my father!
WHY?
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
How do we know this is the way?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Is there nothing men can do?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
No. 
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
You don't love ME.
Aaagh! Rape!
I didn't mean to!
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We're missing all the fun...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
Look, the sky is blue...
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
But you're the Gods!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
A magic dishcloth.
What do you think?
Well, what else do we do?
Look, I bagged it last week.
I AM one, Dad!
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
And keep your sword greased.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Ms. Kruczynski?
What's wrong with me?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Rockville Center.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Probably see you at the book store.
You know Wilmont?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Frost?
It's pretty.
What do you want to hear?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Okay.
You should stay.
Yeah.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Let's talk about it later.
I want to know you.
Yeah, Tangerine?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Yeah.
We did talk about Naomi.
Probably.
I know.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
I wish we did. You married?
Female.
I think I should go back.
A bully? Moi?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Hi.
I should maybe talk to you.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
We haven't checked.
Where?
What's this?
Nothing.
I know what it is.
Mary...
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
We can't do this.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Yeah?
This one's history. Moving on...
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Are you in show business?
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
You weren't there. I saw it.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Trauma.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
What's happening...?
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
...you okay?
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Any survivors?
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
What about it?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You... You can't do that!
Weir is dead.
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
But...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
What is it, Smith?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Where is it, where is it...
We can take the filters from the Clark...
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Miller, come in...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
No. I saw nothing.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
It's cold.
How?
What is it?
The forward airlock.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
He didn't.
I'm worried about you.
What did you wish for, honey?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Isn't that your speech?
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Stay right. Left is trouble.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
Are you kidding?
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
What are you doing?
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Totally.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Why can't you do it?
Is everything okay at work?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
They were left over from the last shift.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Dad says you have to get up!
Get a ride with somebody.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
What's going on?
Take that back.
It's definitely your mama.
All right... where did you see her?
She's in my biology class.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
I thought he was out of town.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Really?
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What variables?
Was it great?
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Does that ever happen?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
It couldn't be.
What do you want?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
That's a nice shirt.
Are you really nineteen?
Is this your first time?
You keep them.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
I don't know.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
What happened? What did they do to her?
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Oh, my God!...
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
Not much. Why?
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
How about a check?
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Some of what?
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
We should go! We should go right now!
I don't think you should...
I think I know where a CB is.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
What!? I'm not going down there again!
What?
We're better off.
What now, Geronimo?
We gotta be close.
What? Really?
What's going on between you two?
Max?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
Bullshit.
Fine, Chief.
What?
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Am I too heavy for you?
What's wrong?
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Frances?  Oh no.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Frances.
What does Clifford say?
...Yes.
No?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
No.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
You really want to go?
I know that, Dad, but --
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Bread?
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Fifteen.
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
You can always come see it in London.
Are you an actor?
Why... yes.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
I should've known...
I guess.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
To quarter-horses.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
And no people.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Say you promise.
Don't... talk crazy.
No!
You're not going anywhere!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Normal. Average.
Is there something else?
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Frances, I'm warning you...
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
You were with him at the end.
Nice.
Yes. Very close
Come warm yourself if you like.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
I don't know.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
God took her from us.
And you?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
I wish to be your husband.
Your decision. For us.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
No. But someday.
I was just clearing my throat.
Quite a few.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
I've been preoccupied.
What happened up there?
Preposterous.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You want to leave?
How come you're leaving?
What'll you do when you leave here?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
You know what I said, though.
I had to.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Whassamatta?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
That's thirty percent.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
What's this guy's problem?
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
She's dead?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Mexico.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
-- see this, television!
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
Start the car.
Gotcha!
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
She's in the other room.
Yes.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Yeah.
Standing right here in my office.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
"Coronado."
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh, ma'am.
You know him.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
No, ma'am.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
I oughtta report you.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
Jordan...
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
What about him.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Whose orders were those?
And how do you know that?
At first.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Sorry, didn't mean to --
32 feet, six inches!
Maybe half.  Not even.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Say again?  How many micks?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Where's Audrey?
What?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
What are you doing?
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Merde!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
You're fast.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
"Go into the cloud! ...
I don't know.
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
It's okay. Listen-
How did you come to that conclusion?
What's the weather like outside?
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Are they behind us?
Can it be repaired?
Right.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
I... certainly, but-
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
Anything.
It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
What are we going to do?
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
What is this?
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
What's your advice, Alexander?
Yes, I believe so.
I'm not sure.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
The British army, sir!
They help me understand why we fight.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
These supplies...?
And how rusty are these muskets?
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
I feel the same, sir.
Surely you knew this was coming.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
That's right...
I think I heard that.
Martha... what?
But, you do come from a military family?
General Greene?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
That's a lie!
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
Let's get you darker!
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
I reserved a Cadillac.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
And that's for the airport.
I have to ask you for that key.
So... how many movies you been in?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
You know how to write one of these?
What money?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
I can't do it.
C-18.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Who?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
You say look at you?
Why would I do that?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Maybe a few times I have.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
She looks familiar.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
How about this?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Compass.
Whatta you think, Chill?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
How'd you know I was here?
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
You saw that one?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
You been here the whole time?
I got you a copy of the script.
Depends, who pays?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You thought I was faking?
You okay?
Were you scared up there?
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
He already knew it.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Harry -
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
A passenger liner. Over.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
What? You sure?
Fucker!
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
What?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
What about running number two by itself?
How long?
Went aboard.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
No.
Nope.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
There's somebody else on this boat.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
You just shoot at something?
Smashed it up pretty bad.
February first.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Showing you what?
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Too deep to anchor out there.
I don't know.
Ho-ly shit.
What happened?
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
A what?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Are you still looking for a job?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Hmm.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
It's not optional!
Hi... what's up?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
Why?
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Shut up!
What? Why?
Good.
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Does Oomie really like this show?
So what should we do?
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
What does it stand for?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I want to "make love" to him.
SHUT UP!
What's he doing now?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
That was truly pathetic.
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Oh yeah...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
How about this one?
What? Where?!
Where?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
Like what?
Which one?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
Fuck it. Everything must go!
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Hi.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
You still interested in that?
Tell me what?
That tape sucked, by the way!
Go die, asshole!
...are you waiting for a bus?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Hey, where are you going?
That's five hundred dollars.
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Well are --
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
That's the spirit!
Oh yeah?
Hi, it's me...
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Does that mean you don't like me?
In what way do you mean?
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
What?
So where would we go?
What do you want?
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
Why would she be hiding from me?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
What?
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
What a good week.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Got me out of trouble.
But of course yours worked.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
What are they looking at?
Nonsense.
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
What do you want with my baby?
Everybody has a choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
We don't have a relationship.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Hello, Peter.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
I don't know what to do anymore.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Like what?
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
Hello, Venkman.
From where -- Neptune?
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
What's that?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
Did you find anything at Dana's?
What happened?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
No, I just thought --
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Ummm -- figure eight?
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's too bad.
You're quite a housekeeper.
Are you all right?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Out!
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Do you want this body?
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Die in what sense?
The EPA?  What's he want?
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Nervous?
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
What on earth gave you that idea?
Something was definitely here.
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
All right.  I'll try.
What do I say?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Third floor.  Get down here,
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
And the seas would boil ...
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
Those are priceless sculptures.
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Yes?  Go on!
Not yet, dear brother...
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
Then you'd be out of a job.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
They won't break this one.
Where is my family?
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Take grain away from the army?
Marcus Aurelius has died.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
I'll nose around...
God of passages and changes?
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
Why you?
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
What deal?
What about their philosophy lessons?
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
Take your hands off me animal!
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Do you always drive like this?
Could you do it?
But, Elaine --
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
I'm meeting someone.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I want to ask you a question.
Come in.
I said I think it is.
Well, I want you to leave.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Let me go.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
What are you going to do now?
I don't understand.
I might.
We just can.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
No.
Hello -- who is this?
Yes, sir.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
You're not one of those agitators?
What did you do to her?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I'd rather not.
Benjamin?
Where are you?
Can I help you, sir!
What?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Is there an ashtray in here?
No.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
No. 
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Did you know that?
What do you think?
So?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Her portrait?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Yes.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Benjamin.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Wait a minute.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Always?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Thank you.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
See if you can guess.
Art.
Kind of.
Well how did it happen?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
No.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's drop it.
Yes.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
No -- actually I'm not --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
When I go off?
Nothing else.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
To be what?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Say that again.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Oh no.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
Why?
That's quite a statement.
You miss the point.
Benjamin -- where are you?
I'd like to discuss this.
It's a short life and a gay one...
I could take care of her.
What about the money?
I'll pay you back.
That.
Oh!
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
No -- why? -- should I?
Very little.
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Chasing what?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
And what do you do -- now?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Bless you...
Then you know him?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
I take five hundred.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
Oh!
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
A man might what?
Yes.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
What brown hands you have.
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Definitely off.
Can you pay some attention to me?
I had to arrange about the trip.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
You're a deep one.
I can't dance tonight --
Madam has slept well?
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
There was -- there was.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Certainly, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
How is the house?
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Bobo, no, I --
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
I know.
Roy Dillon.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Her job.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Oh, don't be stupid.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
I went out to Delmar.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
You up to it now?
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
No question, huh?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Nothing.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Now you're joking, right?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
I came to see you.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Yeah.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Is Tim there?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Aren't you gonna answer that?
But I've seen him!
Mommy, I'm scared.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
But surely Rogers isn't --
What is that?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Stay away, Sam.
What do you know about Michael?
We've never met.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Home, sweet home.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
Tell them yourself!
This room is full of ghosts.
Go home!
The hell with the diamonds!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Go home!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
You ever own a motorcycle?
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
I know you think that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
You've come to the right man.
I forget mine for years on end.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Gee whiz--
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Anybody home?
College!
They were in the same creative writing class.
Excellent!
"The sting."
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Eighteen--  and a half.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
Now that's what I call fun.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
And what is his most cherished possession?
Yes.
No you're not!
Unless she has nerve.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Blue soup?
What a handsome word.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
I mean it!
How do I load?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Ooops.
He's dead, you know.
We'll miss you so.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
She did?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Because he was cruel?
Don't touch me.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
What?
Yeah.
Is he coming home?
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
This is very good for us.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
The what?
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
We met here earlier this evening.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Is that a fact?
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
No.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
How many weeks?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Are you sure it's all right?
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
You making a feature?
Nah.
Up front?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
She's dead.
'Sucking off.'
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
Tijuana.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
You really believe all that?
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
She left you right?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
...What do you have to offer?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
In G.R.? Why?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
But the police...
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I'm only human, you know.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Does she know anything about this?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
What happened?
How's your business, Jake?
How did you find me?
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Yeah.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Take it or leave it.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Not exactly...
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I don't know.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
No.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Lady, let me get this straight.
A block of ice.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
It goes on and on.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Over there by the courthouse.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Well, why don't you?
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Do you think there is any life up there?
It's all right. It's organic.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
I have a sore throat.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
This is insane.
Oh, is this your father?
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Harold?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.
None at all?
No.
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Well, it's a tricky turn.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
You knew?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
It's almost over!!
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
I thought you liked being on TV.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
I knew those men better than you did --
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Well good n-
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Strong.
What about you?
Hello, I'm --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
What's the problem?
Uh-huh.
Julia's my second wife.
No time for argument.
You did this before, right?
Oh my God.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Back from where?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
Hell...
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
What happened?
We're going to freeze to death.
Just a thought --
How long since you were here?
How are you doing through there?
-- I'll go see.
Please.
No personal details?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
YOU'D like my room.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Kirsty.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
It's like she's waiting for something.
I have to talk to you.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Yes!
What's the problem?
It's late.
Are you busy after work ?
Can I lend you a hand?
What?
I'll come back later, huh?
What are you doing?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
Fuck off, Barry.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
We work there!
Uh.  That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Yeah.
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Rob --!
Can I do anything?
What needs sorting out?
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
So shall we leave it at that then?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
And do you like it that way?
What were the others?
Fine.  One.
Is it better?
Never?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
It's me.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Is that the last of it?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
You know I'm a good person.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
What do you want to do?
When are you going back?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Laura...
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
No, but...
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
More confident, maybe.
I'm alright.
Nothing.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
About what?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Hi, Marie.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
You share a place with T-Bone?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
The Conformist.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
Well call her mother.
What do you think?
But you must have --
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
It's my birthday.
Would you like more tea?
He was unsual.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Someone beat you.
I've been to Church Hill.
I have friends.
Where?
Who is he?
That bothers you?
You're wrong.
When you finish, what then?
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
A factor of age.
Who are you?
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Will I see you again?
I'm calling an attorney.
All fashionably without heads.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Afternoon.
You're not from these parts.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
I am not ready for this.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Who am I deceiving?
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Complete your inspection?
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
It can be different.  It must be.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Are you here?
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
Home.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
But --
But --
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Hildy!
Hildy! Where's mother?
Did you give her the money?
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Oh.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Hello, Hildy!
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
What?!!
I have a lunch date. I just want --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
I'm not working for any other paper!
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Allow me.
We're not interested.
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
I'd like to think.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Hildy!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Is he coming back here?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Who do you want?
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Well, that about covers everything.
Three bullets! Any good?
Who locked the door?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Boy, did you see her go?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Hold the phone!
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Take your paws off me!
He's harmless.
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Just one second --
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
First you got to sign a receipt. 
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Earl, you must never do that again.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Quiet, Mollie!
What's the idea?
What's from the Governor?
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
The what?
Get out of here!
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Baldwin -- his name is.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
You wouldn't.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Where?
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
No Turks.
Well?
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
The ideas you get in your head.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
We did the decent thing.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
Molly!
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Where's that?
How much further?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
No, really.
But if you did.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
How awesome?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
It's a hitchhiker.
Just grin and bear it.
Check this out.
And...
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
What?
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
When?
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That's the understatement of the year.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Tell him, Harold.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Like father, like son.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oui.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Lila?
Oui.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Loves animals. Loves you.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
One night stand?
Lila, it's Rosie.
Nathan told my brother.
I'm going to miss you.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Where?
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
How's it going?
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
My God! The fork! The fork!
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You do?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Yes, darling.
Absolutely.
What?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
All right.
Who is it?
Your entire body?
No.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Bravo to you, Puff!
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Extra dessert?
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Comin' in or goin' out?
I'm ready.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
You being cute?
So I got talent. So what beat me?
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
What's that supposed to mean?
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Seventy-five per cent.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
I don't know.
I can beat him.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
Tell her what?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Maybe. You want to play?
The expensive kind.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Talk to me, Charlie.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
What?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Do you always ask so many questions?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
I'm not.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
Why?
Where you been all day?
You got it all in your head?
Eggs. How do you like them?
Oh, cut my finger.
No, why should I? It's yours.
You wanna drink?
He's a gambler.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Well, what's the matter?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Game's over, Eddie.
Are you all right?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Yes.
What do you mean?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Hell of a night.
Bathroom?
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
It was so real, Dad.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Do you know how to follow a map?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Who are you calling?
Did you call the State Police?
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
What kind, Mom?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
What's the bad news?
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Can you believe this?
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
Dad, please...
Get us out of here!
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
That's impossible...
You're late.
Sorry for what?
Dick-weed.
So, what do you do for a living?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Stop it.
It's all fuzzy.
I don't need it.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
How' he doing?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
But, Mr. President...
Here... now.
What do you want us to do?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Schneider?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
It must be one of these...
This.
All I have to do is squeeze.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
You did!!
Dad!
What final challenge?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
I know, Dad!
Dad?!
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Ready?
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Just a routine inspection tour.
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Don't let it curl around you!
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
What is it...?
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Yes.
Who?
Yes.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
Who am I?
I told you, my name is Al.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
No they won't.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Yeah...Who is?
Sue them.
Corridor A.
Who did?
Black suits and helmets.
Who is it?
I'll get in trouble.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
Eating sushi?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Help me out, will you?
Don't just stand there, say something.
Where is she staying?
Without your pants.
Much too blue.
I don't know what's going on.
You're doing great with her.
No. What will you do.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
What?
He hung us up dry.
While he makes the run.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
I'll get us out of here.
What are you doing?
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Oh, I can't.
What kind of a deal?
**?!! 
I have a new client.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
It's just money.
Yes?
What?
What about it?
Fine. You look fine.
We're here.
Here?
I will?
What?
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Why would we want to hurt you?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
You may you find all the solitude you want.
What do you want?
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
...right here too.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
And you?
Promise you what?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
You work for Ryuji?
Last night?
One chip?
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
So do I.
What happened?
That I really don't know.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Why'd you invite me here?
Tear it apart?
What's new?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Yes, baby?
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
What does that do?
What do you mean, what's it do?
Alright, alright.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
What about you, you got a crew already?
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
What do you need at the store?
Soy sauce...
I didn't want to leave it there...
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
I'm doing an interview.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What?!
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
What?
Yeah.
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Should I just take the documents now?
What do...
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
No.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Excuse me. Yeah...
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You greased the rails!
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
They hate each other --
Baby. You are so HOT!
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
What part?
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
I'm happy for you, pal.
What?
Who was that?
Marylin! What have I done?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
What is your husband's profession?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Did you see the tape?
What does your lawyer think?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Hello?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
Friends?
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Oh Miles!
Hi.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
You have to leave the house immediately!
No buts. Now. Out.
Please! Leave the house.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Marylin!
Hello Marylin.
Hello Miles.
Rex. Get away from the door.
We are. And it's winding down.
Is this a lover?
He was right, wasn't he?
Of Massey Myerson?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Well what does he want?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
What?!
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I don't know. I can assume...
And she has...?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Who said anything about a reward!
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
That's an evasion.
I might.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Ellie
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Nothing. 
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Ridiculous!
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
I'm sorry you read it.
If you really mean it, I will.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Why; naturally, I
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
What would you like to have me do?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Beat it! 
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Here
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Detectives!
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Well, you were!
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I better go over and see her.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Yeah.
No.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
That's silly.
This looks like the best spot.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Carrots.
Raw?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
You're an expert, I suppose.
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Nope.
You bet I did.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Yes?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Wait a minute, GordonI
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
What!
I am, Joe.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Well, I'll be
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
What?
Yeah.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
I can use a smart guy like you.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Whyno
Orange, New Jersey.
Street cats?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
What do you think, Lou?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
What do you mean?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
Daddy!  Where have you been?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
David Ferrie.
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
Did they live?
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Get a hold of yourself.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
Who?
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Can I help you?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
What's the problem?
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
We are. Don't worry about it.
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
Help us do what?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
I don't think so.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
Why does it need to be dark?
What's your brand?
What have they told you?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Shit.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
I didn't?
How many trips did you make?
Who is this?
Why?
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
Does it happen to all men?
And Annette's it for you?
I go back to work tomorrow.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
You don't actually do it that way?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
He was here?
I called you last night.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
I see.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
The day you got me out of jail?
That's my job.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Ray wants him.
What's he doing?
Did you tell him you were leaving?
We're partners.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
How can you help us?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
What did you do after that?
I have no idea.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Do you got something for me?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
I got a problem...
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
Yeah, I think a woman.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
What'd you care?
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Were you a disco girl?
No.
You lived in Japan, when?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
I'm carrying it.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Then what?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
What did he do?
What's your relationship?
She believed you?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Uh-huh.
Where did you shoot her?
You said five hundred and fifty!
You gonna tell me who it was?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
Livingston, huh?
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
And you did that to protect my interest?
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
He leave town?
Where do you want to go?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
It's all been a dream.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Grass never did that to me.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I'm hanging up.
Daddy, what was that noise?
It's cold.
No. Not really ...
Not me, buddy.
What did she have to say?
Who?
Sarah.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
She hates me, Louis.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
What are you doing?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
I'm not cold.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
She was good in bed, though.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
A good lay.
Lemme see.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Why you left.
Why do you bring her up?
It's gone to the top.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
I love you, Jez.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
What's he talking about?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Please.
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
I'm not upset.
Oh?  Where you going?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Sit down!
Goddamn you!
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
What is it?
I don't know.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Call my chiropractor.
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
The army?
I have some ice from the machine.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Duck fuckers?
What are you doing?!!
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Sergeant!
Okay that hurt.
Done!
Then what do we do?!
It bought us some time.
Boeman, the ships not here.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Jesus, God!
What if you miss?
I thought you meant...
Rizzo, pull away!
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Well?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Push off toward us.
You lost the charge?
Now that's just gross.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kay-em you okay?
Nanotechnology.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Can we get through these?
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
I never saw one that big.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Michael! Come inside!
Colorful, isn't he?
Now tell me something I don't know.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Got a pen on you?
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Quint...?
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Twenty years.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
Transplants?
Anti-Shark cage.
I'm okay...
What do you see?
Easy! It'll tear right out!
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
Really? What are they like?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Yup.
Excuse me?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
You don't know anything about me!
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Blood and guts.
Commercials.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Yeah?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Cold feet.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
You do?
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Oh really?
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Nothing...
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
No...
You're pregnant?
Excuse me?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Yeah, like people in love.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Is this Juno?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Touche.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
What did you do?
Like what? Be a rock star?
You lose!
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
What?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
Do what?
...That's not true.
What'll we do out there?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Walter Livesy.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
How do you know that?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
What about you?
Yes.
Yes!
Shit.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
What do you want?
You think he's got any herb?
78th.
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Yep.
You down with the boost?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Right.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Yeah.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I know what you mean.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Hey.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Come on.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
No, Fidget, I...
Because, you know why. You know.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Do you care about me?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Mine?
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I'm coming.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
What?!
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
It's me. Telly.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
What man? What is it?
I can't man.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
How'd you get in here?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
No shit!
What is it?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
We'll find the evidence.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Have you any idea what the message is?
I've figured out the message.
I know where you are.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Why did he?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Do you like my dad?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
How long has she been dead?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
He knows you're aware of that.
It's a good play, but risky.
Feel like practicing?
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Is this your first time here?
Are you with the tournament?
Yes.
Do you always open quickly?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
You've got to face the things you feel.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
That's worse.
<u>What</u>?
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Will your power outward.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
Turold's son was to marry her.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
They know when they're going to die?
I can't reach her.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She can see the Beast!
How did you know?
Slayers!
It is today?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot betray my bride.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
To the place where Death lives.
When did you last sleep, boy?
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
What is that awful looking place?
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
You had better manners as a pig.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Few have survived it.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
But you would not stay with me.
Of what?
Why must you know?
No.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
You will come with me.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
When I say I love you.
What shall we do?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
You say it just to calm me!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
How are you, Miss?
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
...And how much is it?
...OK... Good.
Messina.
Yes... Twice.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Where?
Why am I such an authority?
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
So what's the deal Maurice?
The new store?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
You can change.
Why there?
Maurice?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Is that right?
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
Phileas Fogg?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Steph.
I need your help.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Is it a boy or a girl?
I don't have kids.
Where did he go?
Hello.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Are you working?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Ben?
I'm going to fill it right now.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
How'd this happen?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Why would I kill my husband?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Did you hear a shot fired?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Come again?
Huh?
Was she carrying a weapon?
What?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
I don't know.
After you went to all that trouble?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
You ready?
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Neat.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Good luck.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
What the hell is that for?
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
No -- it's just -- not me.
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I don't know --
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Of course.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
You got into Harvard Law?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Is it a Kappa?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Why?!
We come watch... we come watch...
More fun win battle?
And you... are you not also afraid?
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
East of Mercia?
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Faerie ring?
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
Don't you know?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Shhhh!
The colt's still too small.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
What make ye of that, Jack?
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Wait, Jack.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Sunlight, you say?
Can't we move any faster?
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Aye... my Lord...
A gentleman would offer water.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
He did run?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
What became of the princess?
You'll visit again?
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
You... you... you mortal you!
The fastest in the world.
What do we do now?
Up ahead!
How came you by this blade?
We did a lot of the wiring too.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm going to bed.
I had them in my pocket.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I don't know.
I'm coming in.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
An exhaust system or a window is code.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
He buys and sells the world.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Is Alyssa here?
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
No one would blame me if I left!
Where is it?
You're too fucking late.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'm not even listening.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
Are you talking?
Why wouldn't she leave?
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
It's okay.
You should lock your doors.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
What?
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Where will you live?
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I better get the kids home.
I wasn't sure.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck?
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
I was talking about our marriage.
I guess I could teach you some things.
The door was open.
This is what he wants.
I brought a few of my own.
Nothing R, okay?
A night in the hole?
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Yeah...
Yes, sir.
Sure, boss.
I got it... boss.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
That's because I've never been here before.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
What?
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Alright. You want some pie?
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
So you made a generous contribution.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
You know what I'm saying.
What does that mean?
What do you want, Claude?
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
Crop duster.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
That's the way it is.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
That was five years ago.
What?!
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
You sure it was him?
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
You ever done time before?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
Lemonade?
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Now will you get in the flask?
That's what I thought!
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
And give you a good buzz.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
She goes to Parson's, right?
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Knock, knock.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
So I followed him...
You keep a bat under your seat?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Please. You got to.
You smell like coconuts.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
If you want to.
You have a dog? What kind?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Hey.
What were you thinking coming here?
I think I'm floating.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
I love you.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Where do you send them?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
How did they get in here?
I am.
Your own work?
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Had enough?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Why?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
You prefer women?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
What Quad do you live in?
I have.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Don't ever let go.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
I don't know.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You want somethin'?
You okay, man?
You recognize that guy?
I was here yesterday.
What deal?
How'd it happen, Alice?
Andy?
Okay...
Are you my man?
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
What night is that?
Never saw him before in my life.
No.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
We saw you that night, Pete.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Where is he now?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
That's not Fred Madison?
What about yesterday?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
That's it.
What's bothering you, Madison?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Where's Alice?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
What the hell is going on?!
What?
At sixty?
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
I missed you.
Why haven't you called me?
I don't want to talk about it...
Sheila?!
Why don't you like me?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Two years!?
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Why, of course. Yes.
It certainly is.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Chalmers Bryant!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Cave, eh? Where?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
How do you do?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
You have no disputes over women?
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
You're startled?
Very often.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
No porters here!!
Oh, immediately.
As far away as I ever want to be.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Yes.
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
Bob, these are all that are left.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Well - I mean
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
What's she got to do with it?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I'm thirty.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
You think we're nuts.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
What?  Who the hell are you?
Sir--
It's a bug.
So what's the problem?
She didn't even know you. .
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
I taught kindergarten.
Why?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
what's this?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Jesus Christ...
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
Would you call this a code 100?
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
Why not?
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
It's... coming.
They're not my pals--
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Which way?
He's gone, too.
Where's he making his big speech?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Forget that guy --
I have to go back.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
I put you away --
They were performance pieces.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
You the only sentry?
... Graveyard shift.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Somewhere near the capital?
The mall?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Yes.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Rufus.  She's a precog.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Sean --
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
Do you know who I am?
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
What?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
I believe in that system...
Why should I trust you?
He's dead, Lara.
We know why John was tagged.
I understand.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Good God.  What was that?
I don't understand --
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
So there is a way to fool the system?
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
There's thousands of units like this one.
I don't have any sugar either.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
All the suites are about the same.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
I don't get it. What do you do?
Holy shit.
Oh no. What is it this time.
What's wrong, baby?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Oh my god. What happened?
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Yeah.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
This is it.
Why?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
What's that?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
I can wait around if you want.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Ruiz isn't here.
What about boxing?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Don't be shitty.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I got no idea.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Sorry coach.
I like it.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
What's the movie?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
I told you what they said.
So they said more than the address.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
What did I 'get?'
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
What's up?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
It's gonna be fine.
Let's just go now and wait.
Dude, we were practically made...
Fine, fine. And you were...?
C'mon...
S'up.
How much is what?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
No, really, mate?
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Yeah.
Ricky.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
What?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
But, Max --
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
The Red Dragon.
So, we're talking money laundering...
What?
Edinburgh.
I'll get it.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Yes, sir.
You know it.
Who the hell are you?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
That's what Mama used to say.
What the hell for, man?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I sure met some.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Tell Him that.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Next week, Brother Minister.
Could we sit down someplace?
I can handle it.
Why do you ask?
How old are you, Betty?
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
It won't be easy.
Hush your mouth.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Sure, man.
I say a lot of things.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
500.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
What mission?
You evil this morning.
So what about him?
Head nigger in charge?
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
What do you want?
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
[What is his name?]
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[What money?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
So how's business?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Yes or no?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
If they like me.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
The United States.
No.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Do you think he'll come back?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I don't understand.
Where's my mother?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
You're American.
I'm fine.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
Sorry.
Where are you?
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
For a year?
[You have the money.]
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
Yes, mom?
Bye, Mom.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
What?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Who told you that?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Well, it ain't your baby.
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
What they say?
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Wadda you think?
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Don't worry about it.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
You gonna die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
I don't like her.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
You want a beer, Ang'?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
He coming home right now.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Miss you, Walt.
What the hell's going on here?
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Any time. Whenever we want.
We could steal one of the choppers.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We're a good team.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Is that liquor?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
But what about Major Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Gimme three.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
And there it is.
I think I heard about that.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
It's possible
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
Very happily married.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Second pint.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Why can't you look at him?
What's wrong with him?
How much time do I have?
The blonde dish.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Sir?
Oh, get out of here!
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
What's that, Henry?
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
How is he?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Yes!
Who?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Better let me talk to him.
That's good.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
All right, boys, here he is.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
What's the idea?
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Join the John Doe Club.
I want it as soon as possible.
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
How about family? Got any family?
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
That's got nothing to do with it!
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Nineteen!
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
Hello, guys.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
What happened, Mike.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
Who's controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Manual or automatic?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Hi, Roper.
What's the suspect's name?
Anything on Korda so far?
For now that's all.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
Recruited you from where?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
You have to. It's a tradition.
You living together?
I can't do that.
Yes.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
We won!
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
How many have you lost?
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
I can't do that.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Yes.
What's happening?
Divinity?
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
How long?
What about the customers with reservations?
Where you plugged-in from?
You're jumping to conclusions.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Try harder.
Then where is she?
Someone you have to get back to?
-- You told me.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
And it meant something.
I'm sorry.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Wow.  Sand.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
... Nothing.
... Not bad.
"Basically".
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
So Chicago's been good to ya.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Whatever you say, Boss.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
I had everything. Once.
And now you have everything.
I guess I am. Just a little.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
I'm already late.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
No. We ain't even...
I been thinkin'...
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
How soon can we pull this off?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
You boys carryin' pieces?
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
What the fuck does that mean?
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Not stupid. Fat.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
I've got friends.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
You get fifteen percent.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Masseria's been after me too.
Strategy.
Shuddup.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Jesus.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Kill them! Kill them!
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Uhh - martini?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
What are you watching?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
What's the "bad" part?
Hypnos?
Don't ask where I got it.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Where's the Majority Leader?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
What's he bringing pigeons for?
You got worms.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Oh--yeah--
I apologize.
Good idea. When?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Susan? Nah!
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
What is it?
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Dinner, Hubert.
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Oh--oh.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Will the Senator--
Mr. President--
Yes, Ma?
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Can't you?
The man downstairs said number--
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
No. What had you better--?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Right.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Why?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Have you always had to--work?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
I don't see where we are *with* it.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Terrible, thank you.
I've got more. You better tell me.
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
What are you going to do?
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Wait--
But--I've done everything I--
Ah! That's more like it! What?
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
That's--that's splendid.
How's that, buddy?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Chick--
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
That's right.
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you want, Senator?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
How nice.
Order!
They think he's pixilated.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
But they did take place?
Yes, but I
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
You fainted.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
What did they say?
What are they going to do?
Huh?
There's Times Square.
Oh, that
You have?
He did? I play the tuba
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Sure.
Last night he proposed to me.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Boy, was he burning.
John
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Me sir?
I wish you luck, sir.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
How do you do.
You're going to New York with us.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Nah.
Huh?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Let him alone.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Proceed.
A what?
Brookfield just came in.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
What is your name?
Yes, ma'am.
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
You mean  by the neck or something?
No, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Hey, did you hear that?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
You can go out there if you like...
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
What are you doing for lunch?
Why not?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
What do you do?
Althea hasn't told you?
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
Lily.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
We're going for a walk.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
Hmm.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Is this the treatment?
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Where?
You're doing great.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Hello?
I guess you saw the show...?
Sofie...
What do you mean, "in no time"?
In maybe three or four issues.
It's called pro bono.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
That's not quite what I said --
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
What did he want you to do?
No again?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Is that the question?
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Sounds like you have several.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
But look at me now...
Psych major?
English Lit.
I'm honored.
Lily.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Relax, I got him.
And what ritual would that be?
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
You shall see.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
I just decked your brother
No, I mean --
For what?
No... Why?... Should I?
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I'm staying.
I think you were jealous
Have you no respect for the dead?
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Juicy?
Hey,... don't I know you?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
That looked rather painful.
I knew you'd know.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Atta, girl!
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
No one will believe us.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
It's me... Elizabeth.
Sure -- I guess.
Curiosity.
Or talk?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
My heart died a long time ago.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
We had an off night, that's all.
Have you ever seen him?
There's just not enough of us.
GET MAD!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
The Obliterators!
You guys going to a costume party?
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
But... the silverware?
I use it... to fight evil.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Hi.
This is bad.
Or Batman --
Through there!
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I'm glad you like it.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
About 5,000 troops.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
And who is defending Paris?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir?
Why didn't you wake me then?
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
No...
Not even the slightest hint of something?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
One had better legs.
I cannot promise you that.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
I know what you're doing in there.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
About Hippolyte Charles.
Do you know what you're saying?
You could hear them?
You mean you heard them making love?
Can you give me a drink, please?
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
You see that?
You go first.
Wait.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
That the big one, huh?
Are they still out there?
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
You wanna knock?
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
I'll take you later.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
What you doing to my nephew?
Elroy, what happen?
I threw my back, again.
What's he doing here?
What happened here?
Where'd you come from?
San Diego.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I appreciate that.
That's...a comfort to hear.
Ah.
No.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
This? I've never even fired one.
For what?
Are you 'fucking with me!?
You killed him.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
I'm just an accountant.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Keep it.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Cover your mouth.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
A surprise?
Foreigners! Fuck!
Any trouble?
No.
He never told about the money.
What do you figure he done with it?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
O, she's all right.
How's your sister Pearl?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
You have all sinned!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Just went?
What can we do, Mother?
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He lied!
Why?
I'm hungry, John.
John, where are we g --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
What?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Now it's your turn.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
O no! Your turn!
John's bad.
Can I have my supper please?
What do you figure to do?
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Them kids!
When did I ever?
The Drugstore?
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
You okay?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in anything?
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
What happens if they don't do that?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Where you think you're going?
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
No more fights?
Thank you, Comrade.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
No, that's not him...
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
How are things in Moscow?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Good evening, Your Highness.
Count d'Algout...
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Is this satisfactory?
Yes, Leon...
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
That's even better.
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
What business?
You're going to force us... huh?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Why should I take a chance?
How long do we have to wait here?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Thank you. Thank you.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
Ni-notchka.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
It's twelve o'clock.
The telephone is ringing.
As a representative of Moscow...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
This is a place for workmen.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
What?
Why?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
On which boat?
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
It is their wish.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
She's gone, Leon.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I must ask you to leave.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Where are they?
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Here, please...
May I have your bags, madame?
Yes, it does.
Yes... leaving immediately.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Where to, madame?
Your Highness.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
Yes ... I got the money.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Why me?
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Mitchell?
McCord? ...
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Why not?
There's no secrets here, Al.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
Sir, the deadline is today.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
The army?
That was civil war.
That's right ...
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Well, why not?
But what are we paying him for?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
All right.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
Jesus!
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
I believe you're right, boss.
Sir?
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
What'd he say?
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
No.
... little Bobby.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Winning?
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
We took his system out.
Why, you got a customer?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
There's no other choice.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
Looks can be deceiving ...
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
Ernie Davis.
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
Bernstein.
Of them.
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Are you serious?
You don't have to go.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Anything.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Why didn't you?
They were for me.  They're mine.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Lost.
To what?
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Yessir.
You gonna drive out there?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
How's that, Sheriff?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
Okay.
...How'd you sleep?
No.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Goin' where?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Hey.
What should I do?
What did you tell him?
I know something better.
Yessir?
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
How'd you find it?
What airport would you use.
Who is this.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
How much?
With anything?
Sir?
You married into it.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
How's that?
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
No, one forty-two.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Pot metal?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
I don't know. American citizens.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Jesus...
Oww, the arm, the arm!
You're lying!
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
That's my son! My son is dead!
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Oh, Betty --
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
All the time...
I gotta go.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
David, please --
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
I left my husband two days ago.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
She called you 'George,' George.
He has no heartbeat!
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
How many men have I talked to?
Doctor David Ravell.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Rosa, so you've met David?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Really. And where was that, old man?
Fine. You got five...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
It's not here. Let's go.
I wanted to make a statement.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Joyce was screwing Del.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Yeah? The sport utility?
What did you say?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
That's right!
...Pete?
Huh?!
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
You didn't know that at the time!
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
I been calling for four months.
Come back here, kid!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Why? Because you can do it alone?
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I called you Sarge.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
Not me.
Be a friend. Leave.
Want me to get a towel?
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
Does it still hurt?
No. Is that what you want?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
So?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Jets.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
God.
Me.  I am.
Remember that.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
That's your problem.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
That door is a safely hazard.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
What?
What's going on?!
That room!
I heard you.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Fuck.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I am.  I'm here.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Huh uh.
What if I keep dropping?
Those ain't cops.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
What the fuck?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
You want me to put a man on it?
Rodgers... this is no good...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
What, I don't know how you mean?
Brimmer.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Maybe...
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
We'll all get out of here together.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
No.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Well?
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You don't know him very well, do you?
I know that.
Apology accepted.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Oh?
Did your father teach you humility?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
These four wagons must be his.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
What?
Don't go in there.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
I don't care.  I hate him.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Father, you can't let them take him...
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Yes.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Huh?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I'm not tired!
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
I don't know.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
Yes, but--
Is there quicksand?
Whose burying ground?
But--
Why, then, things should be fine.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Gage's gone!
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Well, honey...you know that...
Thank you, Louis.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
You have a name, missy?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Miss Swann.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Exactly.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
What?  He never told me that.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Raise the sails.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Tortuga?
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
He may be.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Pollution?
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Is that what Argon told you?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
You're insane.
You don't know?
What are these?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
What do these replicators do to people?
Is something wrong?
Blame the victim.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Just like old times.
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
How far can you stretch?
That's going to fit me?
You saved my life.
What in the...?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
You're not going after Argon!
All the different ways that I could kill you.
That's impossible.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Indeed? How interesting.
I think I better go, Stew.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Are you crazy?
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
What is this person doing here?
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Yeah?
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Yeah?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Right - for the first time this year.
Oh no, sir!
All right, outside!
That's a canary, sir.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Thanks, thanks.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Conrad.
Here you are.
Hey, Gallagher!
It'll be ready in a minute.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Me, sir?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
You sure you want to know this?
What?
Oh no ... I'm fine.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
I won't.
Having kind of a tough time.
Bud brought it to me.
I've got to go ...
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It's six-thirty ...
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
Thank you very much.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Oh God.
What's going to happen?
I could like kill a guy with these things.
They're happy like this.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
So what is it?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Where are they?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
What?
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
BUD.
What?
Do you have the lettuce?
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
This is Barry.
So you can't talk to me?
What city?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
Goodbye.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Hi. This is Jack.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
No.
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Really?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
...yes...
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Georgia.
Hi....what....what's up....?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
I'm going to work.
I didn't lie.
Not very well.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Sure.
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
What did he want?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
...yeah...
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
I don't know.
Yeah.
For work.....
Can I come home with you when we get there?
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
You can't do that.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
How?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
And your name?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
How you doin' Barry?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
WHICH?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
This is Barry.
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I know.
Your expenses are your own.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
I'll go pay for my car.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Why not?
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
It's no secret that you loved her.
Why was it you never took her by force?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Well?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
Of course.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
Here it is; the last chapter.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
Most assuredly.
It's a long story, this one.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
How was I to know, my darling?
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Uh-huh
And director.
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
It's not really--
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
Not for me.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I just want to understand--
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
What are movies about, Orson?
Nope.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Don't do this
I'll hire you  -- right now-
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Christ.
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
You're going to destroy it
Jesus
No, we're jake. But listen-
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
I know what you want but it can't be done!
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
What who's been sayin'?
It's not done.
Hit me in the face.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Stick out your hands, Jake.
C'mon, Joey.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
How's that?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
What do you mean, "you"?
So what?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
At night?
I just wanted to say hello.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
It feels real good.
Should I hit it?
No.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
I like the gym smell.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
You asleep?
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Where you been all day?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What're you talking about?
Jake, no --
Jake --
Hey, leave the kids alone.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
Who said they left then?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
But I'm not a killer!
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
Read some good books.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Who are you?
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
How much do you think you'll need?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Empty as a football.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Yes.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Of course not.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
No comment.
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
I'll rephrase the question.
Is he cleaning house?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
What for?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
What?
Where can we meet?
What you say your name was?
Sure.  It's fine.
Smashed the front door.
What's he going to pull--
You see any cops?
You still want to go home, Moose?
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
That's funny!
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
Where did you get the gun?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Boy!
Who knows.  Plato?
How'd you get here?
Who has?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
What?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
Good Lord!
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Wash up and go home.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Plato!
Won't mother be proud.
You going there?
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I felt like it.
You can trust me, Judy.
How many rooms do you think there are?
What?
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
What?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
Why?
Gabriel, let him go --
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
Gabriel!
Toys for... adults?
No, hey, I like your coat --
No, c'mon --
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Where the hell are you going?
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You forget where I work?
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
No!
Get your own room, Ashley.
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
You shouldn't have.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
No --
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
What?
Five million?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
Why not.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
What... Powwow...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Cancer-sucker.
You want that for here or to go?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
She's using a new perfume.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Just a roach, Zook.
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
YOU TELL HER!
I... sorry, Mister...
Alone at last.
That I should've picked you up?
Seymour Scagnetti.
Elois?
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
A little.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Mr. Pink.
You didn't ask.
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I don't believe in it.
You really think we were set up?
That's not correct.
I got the diamonds.
What?
For all I know, you're the rat.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Our kind of women?
So am I.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Don't you trust me?
What?
All right -- it's said!
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Goodbye, Mary.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
I don't want to run short.
Yes.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
How'd you happen to miss?
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Is that the only reason you came back?
Kind of sore.
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
I said I didn't care.
That sure smells good.
I like it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Even women?
And we're running out of that.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
You were supposed to be reading words.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
My favorite memory was when we --
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Shhh... It's okay.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Buddy...
Where the hell are we?
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Stop! --
Noooo!!!
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I got it!
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Let me see the files.
Professor!
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
I can do it myself.
You're not wearing a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Yo son, check this out.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
I'm so happy I could shit.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
You bring me such peace...
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Objection! Argumentative!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
No, I don't.
Marvin A. Pickles.
And who may I ask is Carl?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Beverly, are you alright?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Yes... but... I didn't...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
I'll take this instead.
You can?
Can we go there now?
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
I haven't got that much in cash.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
Nothing.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
I'm going to find your sister.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Well?
Do you think he knows about this?
Why wait?
Please, Jacqueline.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
And Gregory -- he loves her.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
What was she to you?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
Yes?
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Ann?
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
No.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
Does it bother you?
You had sex with you therapist?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
You know?
She said it on her tape.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
About me?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Why not?
So you have had sex.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Interesting analogy.
No, you're not.
If you were in love with me, would you?
I'm not in love with you.
But I don't understand --
No.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Come on!!
You're not answering me.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Why don't I believe you?
What?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Yeah, so?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
What brought this on?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Yes.
But he won't.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, why?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what, then?
What kinds of questions?
Apparently.
Did he touch you?
I can't believe you did that!!
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
Talking.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Why?
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
You're intrigued?
I want to see you.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
Right.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
No.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Did he put you up to this?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You were prying before?
Really. How'd it go?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Answer him, goddammit!!
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You knew these people?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Anything wrong?
You say something?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Yes?
NIGHT NIGHT
I got it!  I got it!!!
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Care to indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT

Could you tell us a little about it?
Poor Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
I'm...happy.
I want to see Brad.
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
Fast!
Our field.
That's an extremely negative response.
WHAT A JOKE...
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Huh.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
You okay, Miles?
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Two years ago, buddy.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Hi.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
That's your problem, Miles.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
You still seeing that shrink?
And Lexapro, yes.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
What color is it supposed to be?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Are you chewing gum?
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
It does. Feels right.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
She what?  When?
I want to go home now.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Aye-aye, captain.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Count me out.
Oh, boy.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yep.
Does she know about Saturday?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
Is what the money thing?
Slaughterhouse.
I said okay?
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
What?
She tell you she was married?
Oh yeah? How is it?
I'm having the salmon.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Yeah. Thanks.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Yeah? Like what?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Oh, Maya. No.
Hello?
Ken.
So what's happening with your book?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
I am.
You quit drinking?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
About four weeks.
That was fun last night.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
It was a surprise, Mom.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
No.
I'm here.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Explain noises.
Are you going to do this or what?
Yes.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
It's getting stronger.
Have they said anything about our area?
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
I'm getting out now.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Stop crying!
They'll read our minds!
You said something was strange. What's strange?
It's not broken.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Sounds good.
Where are we?
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I gotta be going.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
What happened?
Who?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
That's a lie.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
He is now.
All I did was kiss the girl.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
It's none of your business.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
I heard that too.
You got a place to stay?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
That's the good stuff.
Of course.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
I am telling the truth.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
You're not renewing my contract.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Almost right.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
... Simone.
When is she coming over?
Not quite.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Not if I don't let her.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Where are you?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
You don't secretly want the attention?
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
For her?
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
Is she here?
Good for you, Hank.
I've seen them all before.
You saw that?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Why?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
I read.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
One thing bothered me.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
It's a hotel.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Thank you.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I am the death of real.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
You're a doctor. What kind?
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
What kind of words?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
I don't know.
--What?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Lots of things.
They did?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Like what?
I don't know how else to look--
It's our pleasure.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
What's a "little while?"
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
No shit.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Throw me one.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Is that right?
Yeah?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Wait a minute --
Mac... let's get out of here.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Someone better tell Mac.
That's not funny.
Starla, it ain't --
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
It's my nature.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
All the rib eyes?
Get your hands off my daughter!
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You got my barley pop?
Why? You have a bowling date?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
They're both a challenge.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Seriously?!?
You know this guy, don't you?
I would've come back for you.
How do you know?
Ummm?
What can I say?
Yes.
I'll do it.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
No.
How long's this gonna take?
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Also boring.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Shit! No one's here.
You can't swear on these.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
How bad?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Damn... alright then.
Really?
I've got concerns.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Do you want me to say I did it?
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
My debrief --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
Yeah... Sid?
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Shoot.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
-- never in a million girl --
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
Got hit twice.
Like a mafucka.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
I DON'T KNOW!
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Why would you let her to do that?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
My wife.
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
To who?
What is it?
Not necessarily.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
I need to see Snow.
Don't.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Let's go home.
Is it a planet?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
Sartorius.
You... she said I didn't love her.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
I want you here.
You're lying.
Who are you, then?
I want to stop taking those pills.
Am I really her?
Gibarian was under enormous --
You didn't like him?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
Beg pardon?
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
How did you know?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
So it was "love".
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
They called here after you left...
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I'll miss you, Mike.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Coming to bed?
What?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Ellie...
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
How do I know that's her?
Why should she come in?
Under the table.
I don't think she can sing, either.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Just call me Spidey.
Thanks, I already ate.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I'd never admit that.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Strong...
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Any sign of our friend?
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Mr. Parker.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Roger.
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
You make my mouth water.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
How did he get over there?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
You are being rude again.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl!
It's a mouse trap.
Shut up, Animal!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
Do Grable.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Betty! Betty!
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
What about Schulz?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Anybody call?
Lay off, Sefton.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Right.
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
You can tell Father Murray to --
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Good morning, Sefton.
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
This is me in Cincinnati.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
He is.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
This is its current position.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Well?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Yes.  Thank you.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
No.
No, I didn't know that.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
Trilithium?
Aye, sir.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Calm yourself, Bones.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Nothing. As before.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Hello, sir. It's David.
That may be difficult...
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
... How long?
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Sir...?
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
Yes. And I know you.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
... A cloaking device?
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Genesis, I want it.
Yes, I was...
Then, how --
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
What I have done, I had to do.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
Physician, heal thyself.
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
I don't mean to intrude.
It was just words.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
Is that what you came here to say?
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
No!
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Genesis, what's that?
We'll be going to warp speed --
Admiral --
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
And who is this?
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
How far?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Not enough against their shields.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
Aye sir --
What IS working around here?
Uh oh.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Spock!
In my quarters, Uhura.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
May I speak, sir?
You earned it.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Reliant's command...
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Hold your course. Look sharp...
All stop, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Admiral on the bridge!
We are clear and free to navigate.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Humans make illogical decisions...
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
We're just -- observing.
Find it?
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
The top of what?
I do not know your name.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Yes, sir.
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Thanks.
What's what?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
All right. The truth?
Kirk. They're gone.
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Spock...?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Explain.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
They did, Admiral.
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Aye, sir. Descending.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Humpbacked - people.?
Two?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
How long, Scotty?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
I am well, Admiral.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
A perfect moment?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
I understand.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really.
Do machines ever play?
Chase me!
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Androids... don't have...fun.
No one's ever asked me that before.
Data doesn't breathe.
And our people?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
How many?
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Understood.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Worf to Picard...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
No, sir...
You need a haircut, Commander.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Why was Data assigned?
But it's comfortable.
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
You think they're still up there?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
No. I will not betray my friends.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Isn't it better like this...?
Can you configure it?
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
Did you know her?
Data... are you sure you're all right?
What did you do to the batteries?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Great name. French?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Friends from Cornell...
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
You're leaving, aren't you?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Captain?
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
We've lost Bridge control!
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Or not to be -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
If they're even looking for us...
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
She's here - somewhere.
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
How much time's left of your sentence?
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Possibly.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Kronos, sir?
WE volunteered?
They're dying.
We HAVEN'T fired -
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
Channel open, Captain.
You must have faith.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
Nevertheless.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Because you are dangerous.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
It'll only work for one of us.
Ready, Captain.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
We are being hailed.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
A coup d'etat?
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Not very chatty.
Report.
Praetor?
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
I know.
What are you doing?
What's this all about?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I don't know.
Report!
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
I don't see anything.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Thank you.
Eh... yes.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
When can we expect containment?
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
What?
Smile.
What?!
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
No.
A drink.
I...
Why are you going here? What is here?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I need you.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Yes?
Goodbye.
What?
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
The captain...
I don't understand 'friend.'
I like this music.
I am not a good singer.
Put that back.
On the radio they say it's good.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
No. Get in.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Asshole!!
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
What?
Oh, you're pretty...
Yes, they are.
But...
I don't know where he is.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
You have no conception of this, do you?
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Was there visual contact?
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
To the same woman?
Yes.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I don't understand.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
Hey, fuck you, man.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Jesus.
Forget it's there.
Tonight.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Who did it?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
But this is a bad one.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
I always do.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
I thought we were friends.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
She still loves me.
Black.  Jack.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
And what about the guy that was following me?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Mace... you're a girl.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
No.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Anybody talk to the press?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Who knows.
Dylan here.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Yeah.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
What are you...?
You're a... you're sick.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Another what?
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Do you think he singled you out?
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
None taken.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
He thinks he looks young.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
So you went underground?
How do you know who's real and who's not?
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
Let's talk about Zero.
[You tell me.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
I know, I know.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Yeah.
It does.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Like what?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Oh. You know.
No.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
On the table.
You want this in black chips.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Well... This is it.
I would love to see you again sometime.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...The red piece of shit over there...
Hello?
Hi, Mike?
Yeah, hold on.
How are you doing?
You know, us.
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Why?
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
I got to at least try once.
Well, you're doing so well...
Pause it. 
She was cute.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
What are you talking about? Vegas?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Wake up, baby.
Whu?
Did she, or did she not smile?
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
Nice, baby.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
No. Doesn't that suck?
You guys are such assholes.
Was I money?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
It's not like that...
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Because he's a bitch.
No.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
...shivering...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
Sorry man.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
And you?
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
But you needed a drink first.
Barzini.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
You wanted me to be your son.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Barzini will move against you first.
Yes.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Things went badly in Palermo?
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Beautiful all over, eh?
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
We're all tired...
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
What was that?
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Did he give you his politicians?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
They're talking to themselves.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
What will your father say?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Michael.
Michael?
How is your father?
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Please say it.
I can help you out...
All right, Sonny.  All right.
To the city.
We're going to New Jersey?
Do you wish to be baptized?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You think I scam?
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
I think so.  Detective squad?
What? What?
I'll come down.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
It's just an undercoat. 
Say again?
Can you mix a martini?
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
Your parents met her.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
What?
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Is Freddie here?
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
Ha.
Marge and I are getting married.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Hello?
Dickie?
Mr Greenleaf.
Far cry from New York.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Such as?
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Frances?
What about Cortina?
Dickie!
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
He's having an early night.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
I hope so.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
As in the...?
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
I've been backpacking.
No.
Do you want me to stick around?
It's okay.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiance...?
What about Thomas Ripley?
It is a little coarse, yes.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
That's an expensive gun.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Where do you live?
What kind of people?
The DMZ?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
You must be rich.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
What's wrong?
Hello, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Travis?
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
What taxi driver?
Ouch!
Is he Italian?
He's Black, OK?
What is it? I'm busy.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
You looking for some action?
Well... I guess so.
I don't like my real name.
I don't remember.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
That's not hard to do.
Well, you want to or not?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Who's a killer?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
You don't have to.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
No Sir.
Got your license?
There's porno theatres for that.
How's your driving record?
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Twenty-six.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
I know.
Thank you.
Spit it out.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
I'll go.
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Womack ripped it up, right?
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Why me?
Whoa.
We were in love... weren't we?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
I don't smoke?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
What... do you remember?
Yes.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
I do.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Are you saying that he's...
Harry, son.  Harry.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Who... are they?
But I...
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
What is it?
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
That's where you live.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Jesus.
Who the hell is this "they?"
I was decorated.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
When'd you quit smoking?
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
What?
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Oh.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Ancestors?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
If you have some, I'd...
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
And what had you done?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Are you coming to my party?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I don't know, honey.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
The little Brenner girl.
Good morning.
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
When?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mitch...
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Monday?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
How can you tell?
What are you? A policeman?
What kind of law?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
Seven o'clock then.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
So you didn't go to school together.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Some cream?
Of birds?
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Growing a beard...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
After the gulls attacked.
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
That... that... who was that?
Yes, certainly. 
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
I don't know why.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I'm Donald Fettes.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
Ask this one favor --
I don't think I can go on, sir.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
She's unconscious.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Are you a doctor, too?
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
It might be an interesting case.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
But what makes a thought start?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye --
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Fuck. Me.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
So you're going to kill him?
It's not. I can't take it.
I know.
Look, can I just call a cab?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
It's not what you think.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
What does that mean?
Did all these people die in wars?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
You must have come a long way.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
I can judge only by what I see.
You ready?
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
Is it real?
Naturally I think so.
Why not?
You hold great hope for this meeting.
Where are you going now?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
Is it worth anything?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
Can't stand light?
They're gaining on us!
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Whattaya mean?
We were gonna grab some food.
I will, David!
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Oh, no...
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
I thought we were goin' into town.
Did we have a date tonight?
Who, Laddie?
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
Still mad at me?
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Okay?
I'm tired now.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Where's Michael?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
But, Mom...
Ohmygod...
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
This looks terrific, Lucy.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Are you following me?
Star.
What do you mean?
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Why not?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
What would that make Mom?
Piss off.
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Dogs don't eat each other.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Anybody sick?
How you doin', old boy?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
It's shorted out or something!
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
Where's the other half?
Anything?
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
How far's that?
Hey, man...!
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
What if it doesn't come?
Get back!!
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
Yeah!
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
What else can they do?
What kind of stories?
Yes.  Just about here.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
What's your name?
Alexander.
No, we created the Morlocks.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
We make them see what we wish.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
May I help you?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
I know it's not a diamond but --
You know I can't.
No... let's walk through the city.
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
My God...
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
What is it?
That's absurd --
Thank you...
You can see so many here.
Thank you.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Go back to your own time?
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Might I ask why?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
No...
My father has gone to a better place.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Where do they take them?!
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Sir, if I may --
If I might explain, sir --
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Kalen...
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
We never should have done this to him...
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Relax.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
That's too bad.
This is really happening, isn't it?
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
You two ok?
But I like it I guess.
I know.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
They're not here.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
I think so.
I could try to...make it stop.
[Beat] I don't know.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
Why don't you help me?
And how do you know that?
How...how do you know?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
What were you talking about the other day?
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
So what am I supposed to do?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Have a good day at work today.
You want anything special for dinner?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Hey.
No!
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
What's wrong?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
You're a bank robber?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
What the fuck is going on?
Tell me now.
Who did it?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
What?
Maybe.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Exactly.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
What did Darryl say?
That's puttin' it mildly.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Why not?!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Whaddo we do?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Gosh.  It sure is.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
What?
Ready?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
We can change our names.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
We've gone insane.
What?!
You too, sweetie, the best.
Isn't it beautiful?!!
You women are crazy!
Hi there!  You alright?
Where you goin'?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
So you admit it?
Stop it!
He implied it.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Mary's a babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
I am?
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Here, just have one of these then.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
You own a home there?
Don't you want to know my name?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
I beg your pardon?
A surprise?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
All set.
No.
You can't be serious.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Good good.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
You what?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Four.
'That right? Good for you.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Huh?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah? What do you want?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Ho there.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
How are you doing, Warren?
Yes, sir.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What's it about?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
When are you going to be home?
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Dean Rusk!
Still think Cuba isn't important?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Bob?
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Who is he?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
What do you mean?
Sorry.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
X21, give me a 20.
Go ahead, Ray.
Come back?
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
X21. Come back.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
I'll bet!
How did you know this was my car?
Why not?
Yes, ma'am.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
The what?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Make what?
You're horrible
You ever think about killing another human being?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
Are you really that brave?
It's just as I thought.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
What does it mean?
One more.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Well?
Yes sir.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
He better be kidding!
Were upside down!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
Saving them some paperwork.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
No! Not again!
You're not supposed to...
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do you want?
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
What are you doing?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
I was a victim of circumstance.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
We did it.
Figured it out yet?
Nope.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
It was bad.
Was going.  Now you are.
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
Oh, you mean the thrill!
My wife's house.
I don't know...
I'm nothing like him.
I never heard that.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Where's yours?
First time on Mars?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Shut up and drive!
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
I'm with an very important client.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Your sexual orientation?
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Pull them out.
On his way.
I don't know.
Let me buy you a drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Level 2.  Galleria.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Yeah, sweetheart?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
I'm honored.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Mars.
I guess he didn't.
I don't remember you.
She wasn't really my wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
I'm not falling for it.
He's lying.
You guys all set?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Jeez, look at that guy.
You're full of shit.
Oh, Jesus!!
This is one big mother!
Don't he have a home to go to?
I'm gonna kick his ass!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
Road's in!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
And I appreciate it.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
You okay?
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
...Where're we goin'?
I have to talk to your brother.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
How can you remember that?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
We're taking the other case.
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
No.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
Shu Kai Kim.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
You getting this?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
For control of the prison drug trade?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
The phone company was broken up.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Don't get funny with me again.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
I am going over here.
Was there an argument?
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
What is it, Gordon?
Teresa Banks.
Sorry to hear it.
Ever see her with someone else?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
A blue rose.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
I don't know, Sam.
What is it?
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
It's late, Sam.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
You better dust this place, Sam.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Do you want to talk?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are you going?
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I'm not.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
What about tonight?
What?
When he finds out.
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
Sex?
What are you afraid of? What people think?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
As if I didn't know.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
Very good.
Four cases in three years...
...tell me about this case.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
You thought it was just.
What is the truth?
It looks that way.
You would not...?
No.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
...What difference would...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I didn't do too well for you.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
Dr. Gruber...
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
...that's perfectly all right.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Yes...
Yessir. I'm sorry.
What is it?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Is it over?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I've got nothing to say to you.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...I understand...
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
...now who is that...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
What?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
No.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I can't talk now.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
...one of the other nurses?
...four years ago...
What are you doing in New York...?
She told me.
Yes.
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
Me, too.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's nobody left around here now.
What's he like?
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
How'd you guess?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
No.  I thought you had them.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
What'll we say to 'em?
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
When do you think it'll be done?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
The car's no there yet?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
That was Nancy, not me!
Yes?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Black's fine.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
What?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Yes, Sir.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
What do you mean?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
I couldn't have done it without you.
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I thought this was your dream come true.
You only hurt yourself you know?
Do you have your ticket?
What the hell is going on?
How ya doing?
Do what?
Ya know... "It".
I can't go in there.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Yes, sir.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Is that what you were trained to do?
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
What is it we can do for you today?
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Yes sir.
Son-of-a-bitch.
Me, too.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
What are we supposed to talk about?
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
Artie? That you, Artie?
This be it?
How old are you?
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
You black?
No.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
No shit?!?! You know him?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
So, it's back to the islands.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
...Asshole.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
You up for that?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
What'd you say to her?
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
You find any work?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
And Bobby too, I hear...
Let's leave here.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
You must be my son.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
How can you say that, Sailor?
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Yes... Get rid of him.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Just tell me what you want.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
Through the forehead?
Santos... I can't...
What?
You got nice tits.
Where we goin'?
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Actually... I just want to go home.
It's the Chancellor.
Thank you.
How are you, Crabtree?
You're stoned.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Want some help with that?
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
You peeked, didn't you?
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
It's mine.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Is that really it?
That's really it.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Can I ask you something about her?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
That's a big book you're writing.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
Who?
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
What kind of dancer?
Maybe she didn't come here.
So, why did you take me up there?
The hell I am.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
Want a bite?
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Really? That was fast.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
Oh?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
Did you tell Walter?
Did you just make that up?
Tony. Now that I'm home.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Who's that guy?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Hardapple?
That's weird.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
It was a beautiful present.
Fucking Mariners.
I've got some good news.
Soon.
Something like that.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
You don't know?
I think you do.
I would.
It's not for sale.
Okay?
No.
The passionate one?
Why's that?
People have the right to know.
How come?
Banished... yeah.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
I can't.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
It's getting dark. Go home.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
A diary?
No way.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Ev-i-dence.
No fucking way.
How's the journal?
You don't like coming here, do you?
How do you feel about that?
Have to talk about something.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
They usually tell me.
How do they know?
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
You're very late.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
And what are you doing?
Don't ever do that again.
What?
I like the noise.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
What about bears?
What?
Something happened to you.
Tell me about it.
What did you do to them?
I was always the one seduced.
You know, this is crazy.
I know.
Live together.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
She-hit.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
I'm switching off now.
You never did like being called that, did you?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Jesus, Lindsey--
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
I think it likes you.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
No, Bud, no... not you.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Got it. Over.
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Did you sleep well?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
Don't be so humble.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Oh, Sandro...
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Does it please you to say such things?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
Then I'll see you later.
No, Sandro... Please...
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Aren't you going to change?
I'm not coming.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Ettore...
Where is she going?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Thank you.
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
It's not my time of month.
For what?
No I'm not.
Right now?
Oh, yes!
Often?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
And what did you do?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Then let's talk about something else...
Does it bother you?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
What things?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Do you believe she really saw them?
I could never be a mother.
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
She can't hurt you any more.
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
Why?
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
You're a mistake.
Who am I?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.
I'm frightened.
Did you want it to come out?
No.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
I'm afraid.
What is it?
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
I don't know which one 
Yes.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
How did she know about him?
So she sent you?
Not your fault...
Yes.
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Why?
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
The one up on the third floor?
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Who told you this?
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Why do you think that?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
The science of psychiatry.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
This was before her pregnancy?
What?
The Catholic Church...
I am...
Earthquakes?
Nothing.
The sheets...
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
An unhappy woman...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
And what has that to do with it?
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Saint Peter?
Right...
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Would it stop you if I did?
May I be present?
For the Church?
She's been touched by God, yes.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Was it you?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Eh?
Lay them down.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Of course I can.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Oh!
I'm not ...
But that's not like a real person at all.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
And what do you do about it?
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Out where?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Where are you off to?
Lip reading.
Eh?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Anything to spare?
What are you doing there?
Hiding.
Y'what?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Ah, go on, you swine.
Let's have you.
You wouldn't!
No, I'm not.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
He's betrayed the class.
Well!
That's mine.
But John hasn't got any.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Hello, Faust!
<u>He</u> died.
You like this shit?
Okay.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
Boy, that's terrific.
Can you do anything for him?
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
<u>How</u>?
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
Look at that.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
That must have been when he got it.
Blow the ship up?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
This should do it.
Is it armed?
What's the frequency?
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
How far?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
How?
And what do we do when we find it?
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
What the hell happened?
Martin, uh, we've found it.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
What film?
Engaged.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
Where are you?
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
Kill me...
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Are you alright?
Where're they headed?
When?
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Careful of that edging there...
Still got him?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Okay.
Is this the suit?
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Compensate!
Okay, we're in business.
What is that?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
What?
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
What do you take me for?
Champion to champion.
What do you mean by that?
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
It's the same thing, isn't it?
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Take care of yourself out there...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
She did...?
I thought you were going to be late-
I had no idea you were even here.
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
I mix what I like.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Groom.
I just asked a simple question.
So few come back...
Also Addison deWitt.
Ah...
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Yes. Yes, it does.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
You think?
You hear all kinds of things.
Find out.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
The same size?
No.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
You all put together?
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
He's the best.
Not just that way. As a friend...
I won't forget.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
But the raves about your performance-
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Congratulations, Eve.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Hello, Miss Channing.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
It doesn't matter.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
It's just possible she didn't...
That's quite a change of subject.
Now just a minute!
That was way back...
Would you, really? How sweet-
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
I have no intention of having an accident!
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
Would you?
You get quick action, don't you?
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
And?--And?--
Who's first?
We understand your problem--
How do you want to handle Sloan?
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
--what time is it?
Night.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
I've got a lot of energy.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--there's nothing new in it--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hey... very tense.
You've really got to go.
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
What happens when the baby comes?
Just tell me his title.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Ratfucking.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Talk about Segretti--
Howard Hunt here.
--yes, yes, what is it?
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
It is.
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
Who's Charles Colson?
--has any of them got an ax?--
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
...okay...
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Of course, Finch.  What?
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Me too.  For the most part.
Hey, what're you doing here?
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
You can't sing at the competition.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
You called me Oz.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
What?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You got it, stud.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
You think she was serious?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
That's stupid.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Hey, minuteman.
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Who cares?
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Let me know.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Really?
Also like sex with my wife.
Either way works for us...
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Salots! Shitfucker!
Andy! Holy shit!
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Are you okay?
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You recognize her?
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Psychic awareness. Right.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Alright. Let me write a letter.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Why were you so late tonight
Are you running away?
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Yes, your highness.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
I did no such thing!
What's your name?
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
Allison.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
Alvy, I...
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Me? Oh, downtown!
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
So sorry.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Huh?
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Fifteen years?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
I know.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Gimme a kiss.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
No.  You're a wreck.
Good? I was-
Yeah?
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Do I love you?
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
It relaxes me.
What are you doing?
Following is different. I was spying.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
G-go on, I'm interested.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
What's- It's me, open up.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Oh. What?
Very big spider.
snow shovel or anything or something.
W-w-whatta you mean?
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
What... huh?
yes, we had, uh...
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Oh!
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Commentary.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Who said that?
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
It's a narrow view.
Charlie Chaplin.
Ah.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Oh, Jesus.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
The one with the V.P.L.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
She was stealing.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Well, hi!
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Oh, gosh.
Absolutely not.
What's that?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Oh.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Really.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
What?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Two minutes.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Fuck you.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
It's not like this all the time.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
I know.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
What's a sign for that?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Don't I find what?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Something soft.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
A little out of my element.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Elitism?
Lemon.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
That's very nice.
How's he doing?
Are you making an ass of yourself?
God willing.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Yes.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Would you, like, marry him?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Are you lovesick?
Fuck you, Panes.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
You're a shit.
Um.  Happy for you.
Thanks.
Thank you, Panes.
Panes?
Ah.
Hm.
It's much more personal in here.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Oh Soph...
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Someone who follows his heart!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Really?
You're right!
You -- you think I'm right?
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Out here I'm just what?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
And do Princesses do improper things?
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Sheldrake?
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Really?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
One more?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I don't understand --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Baxter.
No -- it's my stomach.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Cut.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Sure.
I don't want to talk to him.
Are you all right?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
A what?
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Where?
Here.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Are you sure? How's your knee?
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Last night?
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Yes, sir.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Yes, sir.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Yes, of course.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
You left your wife?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
Very clever.
What do you mean, sorry?
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
You can't come in.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Good evening, Baxter.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Want to tell me what happened?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Family?
Who?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
I have that date -- remember?
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
It's a thought.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Dreadful.
Well --
I said I like all of them.
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
We've been attacked.
Which part is that ?
Yeah. Way north.
None.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
Yes, sir --
What do you see?
Looks that way.
Who's he?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Yeah, I know.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Can I go get those mangos now?
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Smoke !
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Who knows? Right.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
You didn't like him.
Our Recon flight ?
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Spooky.
What -- happened here.
How did they know?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
Captain?
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
What's your name, sailor ?
What?
How big it is?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Can you trust them?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You knew him best.
Both of us...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
What?
You hear it again?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
Why didn't he shoot you?
What's a big question?
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?

A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
Have you talked to Eric?
Where'd you say Eric is?
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
What are you doing?
Did you catch Corbett?
That's not what I meant.
Let's go.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
You're hurt.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Been driving long?
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
That's right.  You're not.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
You got one?
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Shut up!
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
What's wrong?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Go ahead.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Call me as soon as you're settled.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
I know. He's just the best.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
I see the help -- judgement call.
Okay.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Nice of you... thank you.
I want you to go on this trip.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Hey -- you let him...
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
How you doing?
I should've danced with you.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Because...
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Terrify me?
Is he dead yet?
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Another place where?
Did you like it that much?
Is there a problem?
What are you doing?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
What are you doing?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
No fucking way.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
I ain't scared of you.
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Deadline?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
'Them'?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
Had?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Women?  No... not really.
Why did you leave the Agency?
Yes.
Did it ever bother you?
Several.
Where is it?
What do you think he's doing?
Check.
But he won't shoot you right then?
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Yes.
What did he say?
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Jesus, if someone had --
Thank you.
Can I ask you something?
I'm sure you will.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Was she the only one?
I thought it was interesting --
I prefer it like this.
Sometimes.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
It's a common question.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
You wish to close this account today?
So how's your work?
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Like you?
How to make a buck!
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
An alternative literary venue!
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Tell them we're working for the University.
No, why?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
I thought you were gonna throw these?
Close!
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Afternoon!
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Red or white?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Yeah, no problem.
What are you talking about?
You're sure?
Yeah, pretty well.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
You used to read.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
If you get out can we be together again.
There's nothing there for me.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Why are you doing all this, what for?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?
Better than you.
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
This is your doing?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
No problem, is it at your place?
Later.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
So go dance.
What if they expel you?
To see your father?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
He wants to talk to you.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
That's deep --
Like me.
Go for it.
I'll get something for us to drink --
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
The play's in a couple of weeks.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
Hey.
Like fire.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
We can measure wind.
Where?
What would you do up here?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
You planned this --
Ergo?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
What are you thinking?
Will you do something for me?
You're in the play?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Where did you get -- ?
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
What do you want, Biff?
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
A mall?
Pardon me?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
The power converter...
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
My guess is that she turned him down.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Hi, Marty!
I'll catch up with you.
What'd they look like?
You lost that one?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
Good luck to you.
Sure is pretty.
Is that right?
Jack.
No.
What for?
Nah, I got me a job.
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
You're a redhead.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
My stomach's growling.
I don't care.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
You said that once already... Too late now.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Hi.
Hi, whatcha doing?
You're my friend, aren't you?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
New Jersey?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
We will, old fried, we will.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
The girl I remind you of.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
So where's Buckaroo?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
If you could, I'd 
Hello, Barton.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
What are they like? What are they about?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
What's that?
I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Sound a little what?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
...Got a sweetheart?
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration 
It's okay, it's okay.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
So they say.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on 
Jesus, Charlie, I...
It's more than I've got.
Yeah... rye whiskey?
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik.
Yes sir.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
What did... What did he 
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Well, some of his throat was there.
How's not smoking?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
Who?
Sometimes I really hate you.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
Did I miss something?
I'm tired.
Am I... disturbing you?
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Why take the risk?
You're in over your head.
No.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
What are you researching?
Really.  What are you writing about.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What kind of drugs?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Nope, can't say that I do.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I don't know.  I'm just not.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
She's a suspect.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
Did you check all four years?
No. Should I have?
Naa..
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Cool.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
They're just words.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Really?
Out?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Who's John Henry?
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
What's the rush, John Henry?
Good. What do you have?
Guess I just got sick of him.
I thought you hated this place?
Wanna go get some breakfast?
... What's the matter?
You're back.
I'm your family.
What's that?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Yeah, it's the best one.
Come on.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So what?
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
I didn't know.
OK! Goodbye!
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Where's the fire?
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
You're not the Mayor.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Photojournalist.
Nor I, on the second.
Your blood, Max.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
And a very, very good one.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
I'm afraid to ask.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I was just hanging around.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
We gotta get those locks changed.
Well...um...her.
Dick, don't push me right now.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
Our work?
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
What did you say?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
Letters in the alphabet.
How ya doin', Al?
Up here, Al.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
To kill me.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
He sure did.
What?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
What are you talking about?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
No.  Wait...
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
What are you talking about?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
No.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
What are you, scared of heights?
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
How'd you know it was me?
Where does one man get all this junk?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Not what?
Yeah. Deja vu.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
And what did you say?
Liar.
Sort of half.....
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
I beg your pardon?
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Maybe two cars.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
It is urgent, sir.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Me first!
So, like, where is she?
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
You see what I see, Bork?
D.C., Chief.
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Uh, ten uh...
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
What?
That's how long you were gone.
What's she doing here?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
This is <u>my</u> town.
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
-- Like you used to be?
About what?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
So... You're ready for me now?
Your qu...?  But you're...
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Just don't tell Lydia.
What do you think, honey?
Stepmother.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Answer your mother.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
... Straight out?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
He does, does he?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... He walked off...
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
I agree.
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
... Why... No, I don't think so...
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Our greenhouse.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
I like to watch.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
No. I'm not busy.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
I agree.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Oh, I see.
Hello, Ronald.
I can't read.
... Sir?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
... Then you really are a gardener?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Well, ain't that the truth...
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Yes.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... Nothing.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
Good night.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Well, Ben... I...
It's that serious, huh?
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
I never played a jewel thief.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
She's very beautiful.
I was worried.
The iguana.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
What about Maxine?
Fuck Maxine.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
It's Elijah.
You came up here looking for the portal?
People make mistakes.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Yes?
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Dr. Lester...
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
Moving story.
Is that true?
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Yes, well...
You married?
The usual, Barry.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
That's the usual?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Hello, Don.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Do you dream often?
No you mustn't, my child.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Great then.
Who's calling?
Do you mind?
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
What want ye, girl child?
Folks come. Folks go.
Well?
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Not like He punished me.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Back stiff?
Won't you be late for work?
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
The church!
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Till she showed herself.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
You remember your price, Stamp?
I don't want to know.
She was only-
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
I know my rights.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
What the fuck is he talking about?
Fuckin' A.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
What--
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Uh-huh.
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
I'm not really, uh.
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Far out.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
He fixes the cable?
Yeah, but what about--
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
Dieter Hauff?
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Jeffrey.
Uh-huh.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
So...that doctor.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Donny!  Please!
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Theodore Herzel.
Hey man--
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Hey Walter--
The what?
FUCK.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
What's mine is mine.
Call the medics, Dude.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Who is this?
Yeah.
Dude.
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Dude.
You monsters!
Smokey Huh?
Walter--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
What?
What about Nomak?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
What?
For what?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
I don't like it.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Where the hell have you been?
And so will we.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
So?
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
You got something in mind, Blade?
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
Getting your attention, Paco.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Don't try to talk --
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're wrong.
You're blind --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
But he's a policeman --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
What are you doing?!
Like what?
What am I injecting you with?
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Just get out of here.
I know. Take some of my blood.
I was afraid that might happen.
But you -- died --
You don't have to be.
Then what is it?
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
What happens then?
LaMagra --
We keep in radio contact.
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
He killed them?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What, are you alright?
Trying to find the energy.
Why?
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
Oh, sorry, right.
Druid Hill Park.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
You said the name "James."
Baby names?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Are you marked like this??
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
English.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
What the fuck--??
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
Nobody's going anywhere--
Who?
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--a Wiccan--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Okay, but--
<u>What</u>?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Asleep--
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
She got <u>paid</u>.
What?
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Does she, goddamnit??
--it's urgent!
....Ma'am?
Your mother's pastor.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Where... where you going?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
Ray--
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
What?
...Friday?
See, I never knew that.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Got a job for you.
For the money.
...What kind of fish?
Dead, huh?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Right. Sorry.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
...Why?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Come into the study a minute.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Jeffrey?
Anything you can tell me?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Where are we going, Frank?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Well.
Sure I'm alright. 
Do you like the way I feel?
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
. I. uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
I'm doing it.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
I don't want to go.
Go where?
On a ride.
Nothing.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Terrible. boring.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Are you alright?
You really want to do this, don't you?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
Yeah.
What did you see?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Everything okay?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
What was that all about?
Really?
Let's wait for some slow one.
... Sandy?.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
No Jeffrey!!
How ya doin' Dad?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
No. you're right.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
What are watchin' this junk for?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
What is?
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
You can't sell this to your friends.
The coca is my responsibility!
No.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
Yeah.  She told me.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
No fucking way.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Oh my G-d.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Please, continue.
George.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Coke.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
G-d, son.
Who's the cheapskate?
Actually, it was three.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Keep them coming.
Money.
George, you look terrible.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
I know.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Figured what out?
Source?  What about Derek?
Hello.
I don't think so.
But this is...
I said, I've seen it before.
What?
What do you want?
Kristina's fine.
Where are you going?
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
Shhhh.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Okay, George.
Yes, I do.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
For instance, something like this?
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Right on.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
The strike is a success; but ...
And you believe the NLF?
Dien Bien Phu?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Second district ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Third group. What's your assignment?
You afraid of these ...?
I don't even know your name yet ...
And how many are we?
I think it'll be a success ...
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
What is she saying?
An inquiry into what?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
So she knew about his heart?
Increase his heart rate.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Did they argue the day before he died?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Objection sustained.
Can you?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
No -- never.
Yes.
She was here?
How long were you together?
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
Why do you think she left you?
She was.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Why?
What kind of information?
Did you suggest any?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Yes.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Then -- those are not your own words?
Yes -- he did.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Yes -- he mentioned it.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Who told you that?
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Yes.
Are you going to represent me?
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Hello?
Hi, Frank.
Yeah.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
She's mistaken.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Why would she lie?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Why?
Why?
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
I can back it up.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Why did you lie to me?
I'm not.
I know.
Please -- not now.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Eeeww!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
That's it.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
No, your kids.
And clean.
She starts sniffing me.
Then what happened?
You drink bug repellent?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Why doesn't it scare you?
No. I was just... No.
Wonderful. Uh...
No. I couldn't.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Where was she?
Long day. Go to sleep.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
For who?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
But now that you have it -
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Okay.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
He yours, sir?
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Just some flies.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
We can climb out.
Looking to score?
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Have you ever been inside?
I lied.
Who?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
That place is already bad luck.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Cinn?
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I can't find you.
Where is it?
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
No way man...
But --
It was just like in my head.
You gotta use your imagination.
That building?
But the place burned to the ground.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Evidence of what?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Where is it?
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Jesus, Caesar!
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, what happened?
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Where is the money?
But everybody is all right.
Yes, I understand.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Yeah?
Me?  Why?
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
So this is temporary for you?
A favor?
Yeah.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
Almost five years.
I'm not afraid of anything.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
You mean Shelly?
For what?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Do you think you know me like that?
And where is it now?
It's in a case, on his desk.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Yeah.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Why?
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
I don't know what we're talking about.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
What do you want to do?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Treadstone?
I think so.
So it's time to go home.
Keep it. 
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Look, maybe I should just...
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Oh, Jesus... 
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I can't believe I slept.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Yes.
Where's the dog?
My husband's out looking for him.
xxxxxx...
What's that?
-- I'm on it --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Sign the form so we can get to it.
What? How do you know my name?
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What? You mean you've got ...
What do I have to do.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
He's a freelance subversive?
Yes. I'm impressed.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
Jack, she's innocent!
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Yes.
You know, smoking's bad for you.
I didn't like it.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Security.
"And your children all gone."
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
I'm going to open it!
What happened to you after ...
What do you think? ... is it me?
Oh my God, a mistake!
A cheque.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
What's the matter?
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Mother? Is that you?
Is Mr Helpmann here?
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Uh ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
I mean it fixed itself.
Now look what you've done to him.
For God's sake, what's happened?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
I've never fired anyone in my life.
No ...
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
He looks like a cop.
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Sleeping in the back.
I should be going. I just quit.
You're going to live.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
No.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
What did you say?
I know him. That's Noel.
He's working a double shift.
She should go home.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Frank.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
That's too many.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
He one of them?
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
No.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Okay, whatta I do?
That's ridiculous.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
What?
You're in the stomach!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Keep it to yourself.
And the rule was...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
London.  That's a promotion!
It's nice to see you.
I don't like the word gay.
Ravenous homosexual.
Good night.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
I write for you sometimes.
What happened?
As good as humanly possible.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
Do others feel that you did well?
Then what was good about it?
People phoned in.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
This is important to me.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
I think you're the Devil.
Speaking.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
The cost-efficient reporter.
What is she shooting?
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Yes.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
No, I don't think so.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Oh.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
It's not opinion.
They said it would be okay if...
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
So he was indicted?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Jane?
I didn't think you'd make it.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Good night??!
Why?
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Um...
You really like it?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Why not?!
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Hi Walter...
Murdered...man?...
Why not?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Now what kind of statue was that?
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Man this is heavy!
What is it, your laundry?
People seem to like my cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Go home.
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Well I'm overjoyed.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
I get it Walter.  I get it.
You don't have to do anything!
Good night Walter...
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Figures.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Yes.
Wheels?
Dying.
He doesn't look fifty.
Maybe.
You're even weaker than the others.
I am a God!  A God!
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Is that your car?
How are you doing?
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
A dress.
I'm going to the dance.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I crashed your party.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Are you okay?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
I'm looking for you, actually.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
To bring you... your birthright.
Cramps?
Where's the other one?
I have cheerleading squad.
Oh, him.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Don't start with me again.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
I was just scared is all.
I don't get it.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
So very much.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Could be.
Buffy?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
And Spring Fling.
What happened?
Environment.  That's cool with me.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
I am.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
God, I never thought of that.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Get over here.
No, no, it was great.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He did?
We lost.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
You got me all confused.
He won't make love to me anymore.
Why baseball?
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
No.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
I thought I was--
But he ain't seen my heat--
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
What do I gotta do?
Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
You fuck!
Why am I a fuck?
I'll take you back to the hotel.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Pussy.
Take the first shot at me.
I'd kill ya.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Don't try me.
No way.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Where does he go?
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
Liar.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
He even played golf with the President.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
...stupid things.
Hey!
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Now this is just a signature card.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
They payin'?
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Why, somebody's complaining?
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
That's right, yeah.
What people?
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Yeah.
She was afraid to call you.
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
No problem.  Sorry.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Hello.
Ace, listen to me.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Why're you crying?
You're with me now.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Oh, it's so soft.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Yeah.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I wouldn't do that...
Just wait there for me!
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
Eight children! 
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
...worst possible time for me.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Get out of here.
...I got muscled on the street.
Thanks, Nick.
You know where she gets this from!
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
He won't let me in my own house!
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
I did - I didn't -
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
He's not here?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Stay out of the way!
For what?
Hey, Frankie.
And I mean... that's no good.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
You got a round figure on it?
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Mm.
All right.
Fine.
Hi, Jennifer.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Sure.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
All right?
Thank you.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
You know?
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Yes, you are.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Get lost?
I'm always here for you.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Are they out now?
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Come here, come here.
Get up.
What's takin' so long over there?
She asleep?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Mm.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Don't know.
How you doin'?
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
All right, all right. But I - I -
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
You know, nobody likes you...
In women?
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
We're waiting.
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
Car wash, Captain?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
I still have one left...
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
How much?
You are...
But I'm blind.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Don't sneak up on me...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
Then whose is it?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
He's seen both of us now.
I improved on the fucking original.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
And what're you whispering for?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Please.
What do they need her for?
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
What about the others?
What are you doing now?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
Sometimes I paint.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
The one in Brentwood.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Did you jiggle the phone?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Yes.
They put their hands all over me.
You timed that beautifully.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
A typical fuck-up.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You wouldn't --
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
That's a reasonable possibility.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
You won't live to see it.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't know what you mean.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Seems like it.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
What's he doing?  Answer me!
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
How do you know?
In your dreams.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Let me talk to the lady again.
There's no lady here.
I thought so.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
He gave me a look.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Good thing in a man.
You see that, Col?
Fuck it, is what I say.
Thank you.
Jimmy.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Sure, Dave --
Do you mean that?
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Scottish?
That should make her happy.
No.
Are you jealous of him?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
No...
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Give it over, Dil --
I should have known, shouldn't I?
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Are you pretending yet?
Happy now?
He'd bring me carnations.
Not at all, honey.
Dil, this is Jude.
Yes.
You said anything, Dil
Yes.
No.
You like me better like this.
For me.
Prescription. For my condition.
You didn't.
Why?
Dil!!!
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Will I see you again?
Promise?
The Metro.
Lucky you.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
He's hot.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You may be right.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
You sure?
Back in a minute, Jody
And do you know why?
Would make me feel better about it.
I'm sure.
Who'd you think it was?
He's at home.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
Didn't look like that to me...
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Having a pint in the Rock.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
If they kill me --
I don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
The teddy bear?
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
What about it?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Only we call them agents.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Oh, I see.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Describe him.
That's not Carson Dyle.
That's the spirit.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Back where?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Your --
Does it hurt?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Or Tex?
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
No sense messing up the streets.
Hm?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Oh. I guess.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
I don't think I follow you.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Where?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Nothing. Good night.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
I believe what he said.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
He knows everything.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
What is it about?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
What's he up to?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Why?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
I want you to head right home after school.
What do you mean?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Not much further.
It can't be.
No I wasn't.
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
She works at a church?
She was murdered?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No.
No, you couldn't.
Why?
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
_ Your father raped someone?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Why?
Oh nice save.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
Stag?
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I got to get home.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
My dad's down there!
Mom?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Wait.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
So are you.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
You can't bring it.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
A little early for a delivery.
Where's Sam?
...moron.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Uh, huh?
Huh?
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...doing?!
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
That dog was mean before I met him.
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.
...town. 
We're clear.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
That's...
You're nuts, goin' back there!
...-ed.
Oh, shit.

...gun?!
...-cho and a hijack-...
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
I think...
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Oh, shit.

Left, left, left!
Come on.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on.
Hey!


No.  Shit.
Come on.

 Aw, shit  
...man!

No!
Oh, no!


It won't even start half the time.
Not completely, anyway.
...-er.  It was your friend...

...or my conscience.
 

Hang...
...on!
Stupid.
Oh.
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Why'd you stay behind?!


Hello.
...-tiatin'.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
I urge you to be persuasive.
You-You can't let him...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
What?  Say again...
...-tor Long.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...-lar.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Andrew...
...-ple.
Good to see you again, Leo.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
...here!
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.


Hit him.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...gear?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
...Long.
...should be right outside.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.

Where's Elvis?!

 Two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
Go.
...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Uh-huh.
A man named Tim Ma-...
...-son.

My secret?
...fishin'.

Forty-seven.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
...-lem?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...on the other end of this phone.
...-damn phone.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
'Course you do, Jake.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
A ruler?
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Honest?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
They don't kill a guy for that.
In the garage.
Jake, listen.
I'm not.
The apple core club.
The apple core?
Hello, Jake.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
How do you happen to know her?
I don't.
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
Too late for what?
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
A private investigator?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I should talk this over with your husband.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Unless what?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
No, not for that one.
How did it happen?
Another satisfied client?
The Valley?
It was in Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
Yeah.
...No. Why was it.
It has to do with my father.
Give me an example.
Aren't you coming back with me?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
That's good. Now what's her name?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
So I can have these? 
What are you doing here?
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Yes. I want proof.
That's right, Modern Times.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
So what's that got to do with it?
Mr. Kane -
Ready for dinner, Brad?
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Sure, sure.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
It didn't end very well, did it?
Sixty-two thousand -
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
And the notice?
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
No, Mr. Kane.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Let him finish, Charles.
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
You've got some on your face.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Thanks.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Yes, sir. 
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
I've got to think of Emily -
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
Maybe you could remember something that -
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Queer?
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
What's this?
Beats me.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
So where is he?
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
Train. It took eight hours.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I just told you.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
You don't have anything to do with it.
You lie.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
Sang.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Stop this. This isn't funny.
Nobody. It was closed.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Who are you to make assessments?
Like you're better!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Well, he missed!
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
That's what I said.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
She called me.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Empire.
I guess.
Yeah.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Wait.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Nudie booth?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
No.
Thirty-seven!
Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
She meant nothing to you!
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Let me borrow your car.
If you must.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
And this is what you rented?
Living proof.
Thirty-seven.
You should shit or get off the pot.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
To talk to you.
Just the paper.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
Yeah.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
One seventy-nine.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
It better be up to and including me.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
What the hell was that for?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Why do you call him that?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
You sucked that guy's dick?
Something like thirty-six.
I'm going to class.
What're you talking about?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
You open?
Here you go.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
I hope it feels good.
That's the price, my brother.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
Dental School.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Bye. 
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Bags?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
Sure you can.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
He knows it well.
You can stop right there.
We spent a night there one night...
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I know...
Why are you yelling?
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
Gabe!?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Of course I do.
You attacked me.
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
We might be able to go that way.
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Just kidding.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
I burned it.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Then where the fuck is!
Where's the rest of the team?
Right.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Rich...
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Appreciate it.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Good evening, sir.
Great, sir. Great.
Try the wine!
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Alex.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Helping you, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
No, sir.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Fine... fine.
We're going to friends now, sir.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Fine. Fine.
I haven't seen you before.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Good. I'm glad
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Four in this block, sir.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
What?
Go ahead, say it.
You like Bach?
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Bottega.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
I'm...fine.  Fine.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
What?  What did you say?
Twenty five?
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
You guys been holding hands?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
It's nothing.
I brought you flowers.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
He's not paying you one cent!
I was just tryin' to...to...
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
No.  You say you're cool.
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
Try some deep breathing.
Tonight it is.
How can you kill him like that?
I don't know any Rwandans.
Get rid of 'em.
I can't believe this.
I never learned jazz.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
You mind?  I'm working here.
What you mean, no?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Yeah?  What happened?
What happened?
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Head towards Union Station.
There you go...!
They said send you downstairs.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I think you're different.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
What's the charge?
Just relax.
What is?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Yes.
If my universe had a hub...
Never heard of him.
Uh huh.
Never, but I've been practicing.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
So what's the question?
Is he dead?
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
You look great.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
I believe you.
Blue moon...
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Excuse me?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Working.
Working.
Night after that?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Tell me about it.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Yes, sir.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Oh?  How's he doing?
No doubt.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
With me.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
David --
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
You...
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
Ellie.  Pulsar?
It's beautiful.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
So.  What happens now?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
A page-break signal.  A period.
And in return?
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
We could be together again --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
What day?
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Spoken like a true believer.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Ellie, what is it?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Hi.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Meaning...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
We saw the broads.
Go git it, Luke.
Here, Captain.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Whatta you so happy about?
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Fifty's a nice round number.
We got it locked in the sock.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
That fool. That damn fool.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Kick a buck.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
No. No chains either.
It's good medicine.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
When was the last time you washed your hair?
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
You bastard!
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
How do you know that?
Nothing.
How did you know they were stockings?
But it's a different m.o.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Ruben.
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
The lock...
Open the door.  Please.
He was in my apartment!
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Just horseshit luck.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
Helen Hudson...
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
One of your suitors?
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Yes.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Can you drive?
Crash victim?
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
What's up with you?
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
You look beautiful.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
You did the right thing.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Paul could pop the question at any time.
I'll see you soon.
You too, Mom.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm only looking out for you.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
Lie?
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Chair, cup and ball.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
What are you looking to read?
No.
We'll get caught.
What's my rap?
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Shocking, huh?
I wish I could have seen that.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
I have a terrible confession.
Then it's over.
Your family just met me.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
So there were no problems?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
This must be Beast.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Well then why'd it happen?
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
I guess I should go now.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
I don't feel like going to work today.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Yes, I suppose so.
Especially now.
No, no.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
No...
Who?
No.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
What does that mean?
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Get that, will you?
Because you're the closest.
Turn on the flashlight.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
You're sure?
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
We had a deal.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
I just thought that--
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
There has to be.
I was told to take what we have and go.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I knew I should have driven.
Going somewhere?
You guys used to work together?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
How are we going to do that?
Holy shit.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
I can't even hear myself think.
You ever hear of jet lag?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Why?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Okay.    Okay.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
You're already a thief.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
No, really?
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I'll give them to you.
You know about Lo?
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Give it back!
Kneel!
Give it back!
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
No, not yet...
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
I'll look around and catch up later.
What happened?
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
They're gone.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
You buying?
No onions though, okay?
No onions?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
I'm sorry as hell, man.
How 'bout the morgue?
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Mister Funboy.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Well, how's your friend?
That's ancient history.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I can see her.
You'll be alone.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
Who got himself what?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
I'll be fine.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
A friend wrote me.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Why not?
Need a lift?
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
What are you doing?
Am I bothering you?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
You really want to know?
I just came to say goodbye.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Where did you say she's from?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
What are the boys like?
Those are my letters!
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Okay.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Who is it?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Well... not exactly.
If that's what you call it.
Excellent.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Just a kiss, right?
I know.
No. This is going to be our last session.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Who told you?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
What's wrong?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Moving along quite well.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
And that's why you're leaving?
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
You're too kind.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
I'll do that.
I did?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
Where did you get this ring?
Where'd you get this, darling?
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
It's early yet.
What do you mean?
What is it, Alice?
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Did you mail then?
But wishes don't come true.
It was just a voice.
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Yes, darling.
But where do you come from?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
But you must!
Your children?
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Don't cry, Amy.
You mustn't be afraid.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
But why?
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
The Headless Horseman --
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
I like to see her happy.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
What else is there?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Jennifer?
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
I think I just got my period.
Guess she never found true love.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
I wish I only had your problems.
Hello?
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Frida, you know you're it for me.
It's a matter of life and death.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Coffee and...
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
It's stupid.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
What are they for?
Uh.... hi!
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
You at least owe me the truth.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
She's just so... pathetic.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
It's for you. Frida.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Why would you want to be a cop?
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Where are we going?
I don't know who they are.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Which one?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Dont kill me!
You know something about me?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
What does she say?  The woman.
Your name is John White.
I'm nothing then.
What are you doing?
Is this dangerous or anything?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
That shelter was in this bill.
Choices???
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Mild stroke?
And...
Clean.
It's a homeless shelter.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
So what do we do?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
That'd be great.
Oh my God...
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
What do you mean you made it all up?
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Yeah.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Really?
I can't say.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
Where are you going?
You find people jobs?
They're crucifying you out there.
We're all set,  sir.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Help me get him to the boat.
What is it?
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
Gasparilla?
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What is it?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Well...
Oh God, it's over now!
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
I think he's sweet.
But...
Yes... sir.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Where'd you find them?
What happened?
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
What are you doing?!
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Well, sure!
Chris!
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Very good, Mr._?
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
A yawp?
Yawp!
Again!  Louder!
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Isn't there an easier way?
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
But father, it's not fair.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
Nothing.
What is it then?
I... I just don't want to come.
I don't want to read.
I've found it.
Come on, that's impossible.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
From my father and Nolan.
It's my birthday.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Put more into it!
How do we get out of here?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
You people...rich people...
I'm not rich people.
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Quite a few.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
She fucked us both.
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
I got delayed. I --
Where? Where is he?
But you must come in.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
How was huntin'?
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Sal.
Linda...
Linda, what's the matter?
Okay.
Sure.
But --
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
I don't know.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I want to go home, Merle.
Pow.
Hell no!
What do you think?
Three bullets -- minimum.
You wanna bet?
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Then lemme have 'em.
What?
Did you go hunting.
Yeah.
Phantom Mary?
Cynthia! Sure.
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Down I would say... What would you say?
Technothugs?
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Mug sheets.
Give it to me.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
We have to talk.
Are you a cop?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
What's this place?
You need anything else?
Good night, Wade.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
You want to be a good detective?
You're not pregnant, are you?
What else did he get?
I'm here.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
I just heard.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
You never want to find out.
They always are.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Guess there will, if it says so.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
Anybody can see that.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Grandma, look at me!
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Sure am.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
What Grange?
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
-- in gold.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Mornin', Jabez ...
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Now run along, Daniel.
You are afraid!
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
Opportunities?
Where did it come from?
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
Coming along, Jabez?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Well -- what are we going to do?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
I'll get the doctor.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
Worried!
Mary --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Come in, Sheriff.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
It is.
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
Me?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
Hans, he killed by brother --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
You...you're an American?
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
I'm going to count to three...
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Yes, I would.
Heidi, I'm dying.
What guns?
How are you doing?
Well.... huh ...
Yeah.  So how are you?
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
What trip?
That's it.
I know I am.  I know!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Yeah... yeah.
I can't talk to him.
I frisk you?
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
Okay, what do you give me?
Yeah ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
I want to talk to him.
Hey... let him out!
Howard, give him the keys...
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Are you a lawyer?
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Ah, Jesus...
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
I never been up in a plane before.
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Okay, Sonny.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Here's your document, Sonny.
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
We can't stay here.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
You're news, Sonny ...
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
How much?
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
Morning.
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
<i>I forgot.</i>
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
Where is Domino?
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I own a brownstone on this block.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
And?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
No, you the man.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
What makes Sammy run?
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Fifty cents.
What are you so worked up about?
...peanuts.
This might take some time.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
That's my name.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
OK.  OK.
I work too, but I still make time.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Tina, you're sweating.
Feels good.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
In the new library there.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
HARRY!
Come over around seven.
Yeah...
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Okay.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Probably because we've never met.
I go to school where I live.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
The principal.
Got any crazy eights?
No.
These are really cold, huh?
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Sucks for you.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
I kinda screwed things up.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
HARRY! I found the treasure!
No. What happened?
George Washington!
Yeah, that's why I asked.
I know I did.
I made the polar bear pants.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
That's not your tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
TURK, what are you doing here?
So, when can we do it?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
How was that?
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
What?
We start our own class?
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Wow, you are smart.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
My thanks.
What's that you're saying?
So, this is Leto the Just...
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Is he....?
Will we see a worm?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
The Voice again.
Did they try and fail?
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
Should I call a doctor?
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Goddamn, it's cold!
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
I don't know.  Where?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
You really think so?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
Isn't he?
What?
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Goddamn landlord.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Mr. Wood?!
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Would that work?
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
I like to think so.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Can I help you?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Isn't he dead?
OUR picture?
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Um, I guess --
How long's he been here?
Oh, hi.
What do you mean?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
I can't get it to go up.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
What's uncanny?
Lines around the block.
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Yeah, so... ?
Great line.
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Mm...  Oh, man...
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
What?
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No.
No. It's a mess.
I mean, that worked out.
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
What's the difference?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
What is she, at work?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Right.
Leave. Go.
Um...
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I know, I ...
... yeah, then, but...
No. Who?
Where?
No... Could you?
This is going right up your ass.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What?
I'm making a tape.
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
I don't know.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Please!
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Check forging.
Do you still have it?
Can I help with anything?
Ed?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Dick... Dick,..
What d'you got?
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
NO, that's fine
Sure
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Why are you lecturing me?
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Yes?
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Where to?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Why are you doing this?
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Uh, Jim?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Right now?
Sherry... I love you.
What do you mean?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
But other people can see them too.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
What's it to you?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
Did you talk to Exley?
I want to know about Exley.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
They're yours.  Take them.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Of course... But how?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Why?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
Should I?
More.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Dogs got no reason to live.
They shot him in his library.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
And now you'll provide them.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
Bud White's been here?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I'll take your word for it.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
You, me and White, huh?
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
When?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Is she?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Not a word.
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
And no one'll know about this?
Brill?
Oh Jesus.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Listen--
Turn on CNN.
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Who are they?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Yeah.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
Sorry.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Drive.
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
How?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Very good.
I'll say.
I know, but--
That's my point.
Because my life is being ruined.
The robbery.
About the accident.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.
Anything at all?
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Something bad happened tonight.
Bobby?
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
The lingerie.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
What is it?
I don't believe it is, no.
That ain't me.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
It is fish.
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Brill?
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
I'm gonna fix it.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Who would do that?
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Mr. Dean--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
He's kidding.
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Did they take your clothes?
No.
I love my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Bobby--
Jesus.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Bobby--
You're tired.
No, I--
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Turn yourself in.
Yeah?
Tell me about it.
Are you still in Crystal City?
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
What does that have to do with you?
Yes. But we can't.
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
We'd have to--
He's clever. He had help.
I just meant--
We believe?
Dean's with Lyle.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Do you have visual?
What's your ETA?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
I don't care to bargain.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
We took several photographs, there's no need.
This is not very good, is it?
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Will you not come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
This is - what is this?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Shall we be all right?
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Oh dear.
A broken car?
If I could just see some identification.
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
I told you so.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Don't cut me.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
So you can shoot a pistol?
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Are you asleep?
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
I'll probably marry him.
Arguing about books.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
For my hair?
Kip - come and dance with me
I mean home.  India.
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
He can't even move.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Hello.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
You've got a mustache.
I had a hotel room.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Or my wife's.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Seems I am.
I've got something...
For God's sake.
But Roki said--
We going somewhere?
He says they turned the card down.
I don't believe this.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
You bought this for me?
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
One, two, three...
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
We did it.
Okay, you're a thief.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Hmmm...44 long.
And the money goes--
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Not for me.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
The early bird gets the damn worm.
This is just show and tell.
She's calling the shots now.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
See you.
250,000?
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Tony Marvin.
It's those files you asked for.
There's more than one?
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Oh, my God.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
You do know how to do that, don't you?
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
So what made you think it was?
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
You think there's more?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
And that's what caused the contamination?
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
I like this case.
Hey.  I like working with you.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Someone's following me.
What?  Who?
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
So what are you thinking?
Why good?
How dare you take that away from me.
Uh-huh.
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
You see your office?
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Right.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And ...?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
No.
Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.
Thanks for reminding me.
What?  But you been working so hard --
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
About this.
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
There's something else, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
I can help them!
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Howls.
Well, it's been awhile.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
I have felt it.
Our destruction?  Who?
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
I think we're in trouble.
What are you so grouchy about?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Does Luke know?
An Imperial probe droid.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
How do I look?
He found him in a junk pile ...
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
What?
The deflector shields are gone.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Jabba the Hutt?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
But I feel The Force flowing!
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
No!
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Yes, My Lord.
Believe what?
Zira, are you mad?
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
They look pretty docile.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Give it to me.
What?
I need a favor.
I'm already dead.
I see your point. What's the favor?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Delgado?
I said pull over.
How do you know all this?
Aw, come on, Snake.
I don't know about this thing.
Where?
How do we get out of here?
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Who is Merlin?
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
Yes.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
I left it in the tent, sir.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
Who does it serve?
Me?
To me? But why?
Very well. Climb up.
I will run.
I'm not jealous!
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
They do.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
Well what's wrong?
What honey?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
What didn't he tell you?
Would you like some more coffee?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Excuse me Miss?
A man to see you.
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
So, what causes this?
Chris MacNeil?
Pretty close.
No.
On what?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
To begin with it could make things worse.
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Please.
What kind of stuff?
Wait a minute you need two.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Mr. Dennings?
Well I heard differently.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Withering Heights.
Who's in it?
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
It would bring us together.
Ego te abslovo.
I'm all right.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
I've seen him.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Sick priest, is that it?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Maybe next time.
Just the same.
What's wrong with them?
No bones?
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Count it.
You're their uncle.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Only on odd days.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
This time you gotta go.
Yeah?
Nice, huh?
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
No?
What was it like?
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
I'm not unhappy.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
I'll drop the eighths.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
You hit me.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Hey, Frank.
Yeah.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Yeah.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
What the hell are these?
What are you talking about?
Expensive hangover.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
You're making things up, Frank.
The tenth's out.
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Jack, you're on television.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Fuck you.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
This is where the auditions were.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
We're a team.  We work together.
Where's your dress?
That!  You can't wear that!
I wear a seven.
They're nines.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
How come?
He doesn't bite.
All right.  Hold on.
No.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Forget it.
Every year.
In and out.
You were good.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
So, what happened?
What kind?
Let me get the light.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Looks old.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Fine.  You?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
You mean if I get sick?
... Thanks.
He's lying.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
Is someone there?
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
You'll what?
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
Clarissa left those here.
What happened?
What happened?
You merciless bastard!
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
You're wearing your suit --
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Great.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
Kate Reynolds...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Hello?
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
And I know people.
No.
Rise...and...shine...!
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Wheres my real dad?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Very nice. What is it?
What are you doing?
I dont think so.
Damn...
Pretty much.
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
For us, Kate.
I can't seem to let go of you...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
What are you doing?
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
Are you out of your mind?
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
To Paris. Paris, France.
Dont get on that plane!
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
He certainly has your number, Alan.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
I'd like that, too.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
What the --!
Ben --
We're working as hard as we can --
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
He didn't.
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Me like-y.
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Leonard, how's the feed?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Yes, thanks.
For science.
What?  What do you mean you --
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Victor, your scar --
The less time, the better.
I'd hold that off awhile.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
How bad off is he?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Trip? Where to?
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
He's making a fine recovery.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
You must carry spare parts --
No, it requires such absolute precision --
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
What do you mean?
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
About forty miles an hour.
Tell them to take us out.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
What's wrong, Skipper?
The Wall's transparent...
What's this, sir?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Clear him off the road.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Oh, geez.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uhn.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
No. No, ma'am.
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Yah, but -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yah, real good.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Yah!
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Yah, okay.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Yah - how are you doon?
I'm sorry.
No, I didn't...
Yep.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
What'd he say?
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
No, no.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
We need to talk.
Yes?
What does that mean?
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
And I saw you practicing this...
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
I found a new one.
This could go on for hours.
So you're staying in tonight?
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Feel anything?
Whatever.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
What?
We did make love?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
You are an insane person.
Who's this?
Oh, yeah.
Who do you think I am?
My suitcase was vibrating?
What do you want me to do?
How's that working out for you?
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
...no ...no ...
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
I don't... think so.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Yes, you can.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
How do you feel?
Call what off?
What fight?
What?
Promise you won't.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
No, I'm not...
I feel sick.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
Look...
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I don't know!  Nothing!
What?
"Too young?"
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Why are you doing this?!
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Appreciate something.
Really?
Did you hear what I just said?!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Six duds in a row.
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Should we knock?
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Whoa, nine months?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
What is it?  What are you?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
That's why I was there last night.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
Remember the departure time?
Fag.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Huh?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Gettin' old, huh?
Read you.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
You better take off.
Huntington Beach, California.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Not yet.
It's not necessary.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Let's do it.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Yep! Right on it!
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
Can I have my desk please.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
How have you been?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Can I help you?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
How un-sixties of you.
Hello Lydia?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Now what?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>?!
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
They work for Him.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
You advise us!
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
You don't have to say that.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
No.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Rayette.
What?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Washington.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Where are you going?
Can I get you anything else?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
You want me to hold the chicken.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Who's Van Oost?
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
With applesauce?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Thank you.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
You had no inner feeling?
Wait...
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
I think it's what you think.
No inner feeling.
I have to talk to you.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
That'll make you happy.
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
All right, let's have a rematch.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
I don't think that's true.
And what about love?
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
You know somebody around here?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
So what girls are over there?
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
A girl named Amanda.
She didn't say she had no man.
So what do you want with her anyway?
How do I know you're not lying.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Creasy, how old are you?
Nineteen.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
We play tennis at the club.
I don't know. I don't have any.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
You don't know me.
You gonna nail the chief?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Has he?
He sighs.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
We can't talk about it here.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Not me.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Why do you keep doing this?
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
What about his parents?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
I think you better sit down.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Cabana one.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
Who are you?
Two...
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
I never read the paper.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
Fletch, you want an apology?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
But I ain't got you...
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Now that we've broken the ice...
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
That was close...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Thanks for the promotion, man.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
You okay?
It's red, Ford.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
People still watch that?
Ick.
I can't kill this kid's father...
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Who cares?  I got a case.
It's me.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Two words.  Disco Express.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Shock.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
That's funny, you're cute.
This isn't music!
What's my name?
I'm clean.
No - no.
Where do you want it?
Where are you?
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Sale boulot.
What happens to the schedule?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
You want some eggs.
Yeah!
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
Popeye.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Same car.
What is that old building?
I been damn careful up to now.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
How do we get to the vault door?
Butch called.
What do you mean?
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
What?
Hello?
Oh my god.
Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
No wait, don't go!
Fire.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
Yeah, it's me.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
When?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
How?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
In my pocket.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Gordo?
I better give you my address then.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Uh, huh.
What?
Are you a good cop, John?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Wife around?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
No kiddin'?
Who the fuck is this?
Fuck you, asshole.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Why don't we go take a swim?
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
What's this?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
You know him?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Are they following us?
Got any good ideas?
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
I have to.
I just want you to like me.
Oh, jeez.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Is that all you found?
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
I thought Jason was only a legend?
What?
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Did you hear me?!
Why?
But what if they try and scare us?
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Jesus!
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
Yeah...
I've told you the truth.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Tell me.
But I thought...
They're out of town.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I...I can't...
I don't know what to say...
I've got the numbers.
I heard you weren't coming.
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
We must abandon.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
What was it like?
Where are you going?
Unbelievable.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
If you're wondering about the firearm.
Two-all after six.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Joanne Bourne.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
They're only gonna lose.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
My back is killing me.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I know, Pop.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
I want to believe.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Washed away.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Have to hurry back.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
This could be it.
A little.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I hear good things about the new play.
Do you think he can do it?
I don't know.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Yes.
I haven't come to you.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
Are you sure?
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
I am your wife.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
I'm sorry.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
You've done me a great service.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
You're an extraordinary man.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Who are you trying to convince?
Er, no...
It's about the Director.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
You had to be a right-hander.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
Come on--we're taking off.
How long?
Hello?
Why have you done this?
Anything I've forgotten?
Vincent...Vincent...
I was at home.
Why don't we say we were together?
Have they found our friend?
My medication.  I left it back there.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
All it takes is a long arm.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You okay?
You been okay?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
I mean it.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
A man helped me open it...
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
When we had trouble before it was different.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
You're full of ifs.
Only one car.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
No more about Beynon.
Okay.
You okay?
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Suit yourself.
Wire pull over?
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
He took the day off.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
A couple of weeks back.
Oh ay?
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Everyhing go off all right?
What about?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
He was all right to me.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
What was bugging Frank?
What?
I know him too.
Who?
Oh, do you?
We went about together.
While he was here. You went about together?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
That's why you waited for me.
You sure about that?
I don't know.
Shouldn't think so.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Yeah.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
I'll call the police.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
So shut up.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Are you awake?
No. Are you tired?
What you going to do?
Meaning what?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Jack! I didn't like that.
Yeah.
What's that? A hundred?
Polacks and deadbeats.
It's too...
Eh...?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
Who?
The nurses?
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
What hard part?
No.
They have...
What?
Somebody...
We're just "talking" about it.
As an idea.
What did you say?
Did I say that?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
A job with Graff.
You...
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You went for it.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
You need money?  Is that the...
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
No.
Will you excuse...
Did they catch...?
That they're going to be upset.
Aaronow...
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Mr. Levene...?
You're done, come down, and let's...
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...do you want to go downtown...?
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Roma.
...after the thirtieth...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
...ah, fuck this...
What are we going to say?
I'm not sure I have two.
Alright.
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
Get 'em to me!
You are?
Why I don't...
Excuse me...
You robbed the office.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
John: John:...my daughter...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Fuck you, Dave...
"Always be closing..."
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
What is it?
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Uh...
Oh!  For the magazine...
You're sure?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Mmmm...
I've got to talk to you.
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
This.
You cashed the check?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuck you.
I'm going home.
Have a good trip.
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Yes.
...Mr. Williamson...
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
The children can stay.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
I don't want to stay here...
No, Dad.
Not for strangers; for my country.
He will grow strong.
Ready, Frankie.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Beautiful.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
Why didn't someone tell me!
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
I took care of it.
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
They are everywhere!
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
What the hell are you talking about?
Do you owe markers?
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
You said you were Klingman.
However I can help you...
This doubles my investment.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
No.
I deny his every charge.
That is a complete falsehood.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Rosato, where's your brother?
What if I say shove it?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Fuck you.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
So what did you think?
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
And your name is --?
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
I'm not, you know.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Why not?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
Do you miss it?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
You were a soldier?
I'm game.  Sure.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
A very lucky thing indeed.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
What won't do?
Why?
All right.  Let's take it off now.
Did I hurt you?
You'll feel better tomorrow.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
What are you doing here?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
You only embarrass yourself.
So what do I do?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can that count as one question?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
What about?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Let them go --
And this has what to do with me?
I'm on the move -
Consider me gone, Detective --
Double-meaning intended --
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
What for?
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Got it ...
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Most of 'em are late-model...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
You all right -- ?
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
You?
Come here --
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
And here I am...
And you got some Italians -- ?
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
That's what I want ...
You mentioned that in your letters
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Unlock your button ...
Where to -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Is he still working here ?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
No we don't -
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
Not really -
Uh ... Randall -- ?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Nods again.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
What do you do?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
We've got to help each other.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
I flushed it down the toilet.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
I better call again.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Yeah.
He heard.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
He didn't call?
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
What do we got?
Gone.
It's a way outta here.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Ah, history I think.
I guess so.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Yah, that is a nice ass.
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Why don't you beat off at your house?
What is it?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Half-red, half-black--
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
I can come back.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Hello.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
Yeah.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Can we do it at my office?
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
So I hear you're taking some time.
Do you know when you'll be back?
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Why thank you.
You've never been on a plane.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
Do you think you're alone?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
They're all dead.
Not to me, they're not.
I didn't ask for this.
What?
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
You want to read it?
I used to go with the wrench.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
No. Thank you.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
No.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
Want me to take a look?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Just for fun?
I want you to come with me.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
I'm not honest?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Sure, but what is this?
Joad. Tom Joad.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
Excuse me for asking.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
I aim to.
Women is always tar'd.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Sure do.
Yeah.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
How about it, Ma?
Ma, you sick?
Didn' you get no sleep?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They know he got hit in the face.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
But who done it?
Then who *do* we shoot?
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Remember high school?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
What am I gonna do?
That's it?
I'm a professional killer.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Are you going to the reunion?
Bad television.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Seven it is.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
I was leaving.
What if I come back?
I work alone.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
No harm no foul.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
It was the PLO.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
This?
They're not happy, sir.
I'm not happy.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Enough?
You haven't looked at the dossier.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
Ten years. What happened!?
He gave me a great deal.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
To shoot you. Correct.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
This is Annie MacLean.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Poor thing.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Five years. My son was born here.
Why didn't it work out?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
I don't believe this!
Did he tell you that?
You buckled up?  You cold?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Did you ask him to come visit?
Did he mention it?
Well, one was for salad...
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
What did you say?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
That bag's almost empty.
Okay.
What did he say?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Good night.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
I'll help you with the coffee.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Mixed salad.
Tom?
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
What, sweetheart?
What stuff is that?
Now that's cool.
You think it's cool?
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Shit!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
That's far out!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
It was him, man!
Cereal.
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Make it our first date.
You're not gonna win.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Why did he come to you?
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Good.
What's happening?
Joey, Joey...
Yo, what's up?
Phreak?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Murphy kid turn you down?
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
An accident?
How do we look?
You guys always look great.
Found it.
How do you know their not?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Watch it.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Sure it does.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
What are you doing out here alone?
Then we'll be safe?
Why?
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
This is 132, over.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
It isn't a man.
Where's that Deputy?
Thank you.
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
What time?
Look where?
He was standing right here.
He can still watch.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Fancy.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Yes.
I gotta go.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Anybody live here?
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
What do we do?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Jesus!
Sure...
You have the wrong feeling.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Where?
Hey, Laurie...
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
I promise.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
What is it, Laurie?
She's washing her clothes.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
...any sister talk?
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
That's just --
I know.  It's terrible!
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
We're actresses.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
And it ruins everything else.
Yes, but you name names.
Oh, my goodness!
Uh, yes!
How's everything?
Isn't that beautiful?
Elliot!  Don't!
Elliot!
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
Lee... uh...
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Are you angry with me?
I didn't say that.
Are you in love with someone else?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
You matter to me.  Completely.
I am... I did slave all day.
Yeah.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
So?
Absolutely.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
No.
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Hello?
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Yes!
Oh, great.
Do you miss Frederick?
No.
I got two minutes.
Huh?
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Go right over there.
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Perfect!
I know.  H-how much do you need?
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Don't you think she does?
Oh, Hannah!
He's not a loser at all!
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Can we, can we go?
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
I was so bored!
I'm fine.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Really?
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Oh.  Oh.
Oh, who cares?
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Okay.
Just a few minutes ago.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Oh...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
Some museum director disappeared.
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
It's a growth business.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Yes?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Evelda Drumgo.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
And who is "they?"
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
They got that kind of money?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Not with any certainty we...
He escaped...
What do you want me to do?
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Try Barney Clark.
And how would you know that?
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
I think its meaning is clear.
Waal...
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
...may be the heat....
You look lovely.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
The girl needs help.
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
No.
Don't shoot yourself.
...and that is what you need to expand.
Hello....?
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
Brazilian. 
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
You want some <u>advice</u>.
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Why are you...don't stop...why?
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Talia, don't go!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
What are you doing?
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I just never thought of you in that...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Hey.
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
What do you want me to say?
Don't say that.
Gee, thanks.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Heather? Wha...
Where did you get these?
Very very. The photographs?
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Guess who?
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
Veronica, you look like hell.
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
There are no stupid questions.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
I don't know. Should you?
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
Like a suicide thing?
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Is it sleeping, dude?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
Come on, sit up.
sighs.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
You have it.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
hurries over.
gives her a sympathetic look.
It doesn't matter.
Him.
That.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
What?
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Pitbull attacks.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
GWEN?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
What's the occasion?
How much time off?
Yeah? You and who else?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Hello I'm Dr...
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Really, why's that?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
I thought you loved games.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
What do you want?!
What's under that sheet...?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
You okay?
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
Spanish kinda guys!
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
I didn't even know you had a kid.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
What is it?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
What?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
You test each one thoroughly?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
Right.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Do you do washing machines, too?
Everything breaks at once.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
About what?
Did Daddy tease you?
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Neil, calm down.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
I hear things in this house,
All new houses have noises.
His secretary just confirmed.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
I'm having the floor fixed,
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Just reduced.
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Would you?
Anything from the bank?
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
Central Park.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
What?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
I'm sure they will.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
She's the King's cousin.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
I stood up first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
She's a treasure she is.
Aye?
Sometimes.
Then take me with you.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
So?
Why?
What's that next to him?
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Don't leave us, Conner.
Why?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Talley.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
Who sent you?
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
You with the cops?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
I'm here.
What?
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
We can take it with us.
I overheard him with the girl.
You have his address?
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
You want me to stick around, I could --
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Are all of you named Jones?
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
What's my name?
What are you people going to do?
The kids are in here!
We're okay.
I think so.
Okay.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Can you open them?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Who is it?
Are the disks still in your room?
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
What happened?
Excuse me?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
What is this about?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Paul, you know who this is?
What's happening?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
I don't understand.
They fired a rocket at us.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
Satellites.
He did.
Where are my supplies?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
How so.
I am on a list! What list?
You think they will believe you?
Very soon.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
The commander is not here.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I have a confession. When we met...
Why?
No! Sit down now.
We are almost out of water.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
You have taken business class?
How much beer?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Jesus H. Christ!
Where is it??
You said that was an accident.
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
-- the sadistic prick --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Question answered.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
-- the window and door grates --
Well, I don't.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
Don't know that it does.
Believe me, we need to.
Price!
For the love of God....please...?
What's the matter?
It looks delicious...
Good-bye.
By killing them?
By freeing them.
What do these ingredients mean?
Maybe it was Colleen...
H-how long will it take?
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Don't be afraid!
The heater's here.
Who?
Oh come on!
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Whoa there...
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
What do you mean?
Not on station time.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Sorry.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Sure.  Why?
You gonna buy?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Really?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Yes. 53
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Why not just go now?
Now that's a lock.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Wha--
Where did you get this?
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Bunny, not you too?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Snappy.
It's hardly the same --
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Ol' satchel-butt...
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
What a horrible little person.
Confused?
...You do?
...Huh?
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Phony, huh?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Ya know, entry level!
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
Yeah?
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
But --
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
There's one in every story.
She finds him.
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
She isn't!
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
But you didn't have to come up here.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Where were you trained?
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
No, Wes.
A mental case?
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I wanted to help you.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Got a meeting uptown.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
What's for dessert?
See for yourself.
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
That this was going to be a key party?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Hi dad.
Hnnn.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Dad stop it!
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Huh?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Good shit.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Thank you Janey.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Well, we can talk about it.
Hi mom.
You're not a psycho!
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
I suppose. Why?
Educated guess.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
Now you are being rude.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Where you going?
Um, Libbets Casey.
What do you mean?
Major.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
The Idiot?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
How do you know this shit?
Who said so?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Where you going?
I don't know.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Can I come?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
What time is it?
And?
Mikey was looking for you.
He's dead.
It feels warm.
I don't know. How do I know?
Do it again.
This murder was in the papers, right?
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Sorry about...
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What are you doing here?
I'll call him now.
What?
So?
What happened at that signing?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
What is it?
One of your cases?
What if someone finds out?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
How should I know?...
Since grade school.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You and Kay were like sisters?
She wouldn't tell me!
It was like some big fucking secret!
What was?
Who?
Thought you might find that.
Down at the station?
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Your lips, they didn't move.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
That is a picture, nothing more.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
But why?
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
That's what the one who made me said.
It will grow back again!
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
What plans?
I want more.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
How do I look?
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Yes.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Give it to me!!!
Did I hear a yes?
It can't be...
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
We belong in hell.
Why do you do this Lestat?
NO!!!
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
What are you saying?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
And they frighten you?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
You're not lying to me, are you?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Get lost, you scared me.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
Karla! You promised.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Cancer in a box.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Who?
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Julie? What's wrong?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
He's in it with Willis?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
...Why?
Is there a problem here?
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
You guys lost?
What's going on?
Can't talk right now.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Well 
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
What are you doing?
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
What an odd question!
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
It was, the plague
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
What is her illness?
Theodosia --
Good morning, sir.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
It isn't me!
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Well, naturally. Of course.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
I know. I know.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Well?
Mother . . .
There it is, good as new.
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Goodbye, everybody!
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
She's swell.
Hmmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
You're not paid to be a canary.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
He's pretty young for that job.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Hello, George, how are you?
I know, but . . .
Those Rockefellers!
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Hi.
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Come on, you guys.
Wheee!  Faster!
My hair's getting wet!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Maybe by now they are.
Why not?
We better go back in.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
I don't know.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
What is it?  What's there?
On your own time?
What about that camera?
Sean's still out there.
The whale's mouth?
And sound.
Where's my day book?
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Sean's asleep.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
What is it?  What's the matter?
Two of them are still missing!
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
They made me go with them.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Help!  Help!
Tina Wilcox.
Next week.
Nope.
Just like this.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
You do everything your parents tell you?
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
What's wrong?
Heading back?
Eat Cheerios.
I want to go with you!
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
With those camera lights and...
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
Well, not much longer to go.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Yes.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
How's your patient?
Michael, take deep breaths.
Come on.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Somebody better get down there!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
No, no.  That won't do.
No!
Afraid I can't do that.
Still sleeping.
Thanks for helping.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
I don't know, it depends.
Are you really?
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
You were great out there!
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Told you you'd like it.
What're you doing later?
Make sure you put this back.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
How'd you do in school?
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Come on, let's go.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
We're in love.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
You'll spoil her.
Come on, sweetheart....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
He was doing his job....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
I have work....
Michael!  This thing working?
That....
Are you all right?
We don't want any....
The fish.  Check it....
I'll be in to read you a story.
Sit down, Ma....
I didn't mean to start that....
All you all right?
I enjoy his company....
It's late....
Trying to write our report....
You and Sean used to make....
Promise me you'll be all right....
No....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It could have been an accident....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
It's just like driving a car....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
You're not going to bet it all....
I have two right feet.
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
What?
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I'm sorry...I....
They had them on the big one....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Keep it steady....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Can't this thing go any faster?
We'll be done pretty soon....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Stop busting my hump....
You tagging them...?
The females have eggs....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
The readings suck....
Put me down....
Bad boy....
Stop busting my hump....
Where is everybody?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When I invited you...
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Bring her to starboard.
I am...You must know something about him....
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
I don't like the song.
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
All the time....
I told you....
What?
Yeah?
Yeah, he can go ...
O.K.
Maybe?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
How'd you do it, old man?
What do you mean?
No, you didn't.
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
Sure.
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
What exactly you doing, John?
Listen, you don't havta come?
What is that?
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
No.
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
I know what a "witness" is.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
Have you known her long?
Has he got your aunt's address?
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Why does he want to kill me?
Two or three years ago.
What was she like?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
You want something, darling?
He has? .. What's he doing here?
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Well, no you didn't --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Can I help?
Well, take care.
... light.
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
It's all going to work.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
-- especially one like this.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Same to you.
Oh God.
And I really don't know your noises yet.
It's my fault.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Ten seconds, Rod.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Not right now, Jerry.
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Huh?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Is that your porty or mine?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
You never had The Talk, did you?
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Why not --
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
You okay?
You'll lose.
No.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
ERRR-IIIC!
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Eric!
We can't just...
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
That one time was just the bumper.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
I dont know.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Is it a rex?
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
I'd better get going.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
That's hard to believe.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
I could come with you.
Where does it say that?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What in Christ's name is going on?!
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
?!
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
-- way we could safely --
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
What now?
How would we cut off the lysine?
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Constantly sick.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
It's all right.
Alan, listen to this.
Faster, faster!
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Are they heavy?
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I can't!  I'm scared!
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
Machines hate you?
You want to talk about this?
I didn't say I was scared.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
What's that?
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
I'm a hacker!
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
What about that other guy?
He... he's here...
Quite a circus.
Oh?
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
Are you all right?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
-- You appreciate my writing.
Another one?
It's my last and final one.
No, I left it in his office.
... My ... social situation?
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
-- Eduard --
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I know.
Hello again.
What?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
You don't believe that.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
-- Listen to me --
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
No, I suppose not.
What makes you think so?
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
Do you?
What's the matter with you?
That's <u>mad</u>.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
May I ask where your two warders are?
All these in the last year?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
This is filed incorrectly!
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
It's ... lovely.
He's grubbing for money, father.
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
It's the same image - Kong!
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Are you nervous Jack?
Did you fear for your life?
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
I'd just be guessing.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Oh no.
Yes -- all right --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
No.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
You said it was!
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Please.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
Oh look what he did in them.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Well there's a couple --
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
We grew up together. Kids.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
No.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Yes?
Where is the child?
Uh, huh...
All it is is onions and gravy.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Good night.
Yes?
See.  That's my name.
Is that really your chair?
No, she never did.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Your mom.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
No, I did not.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
Eight, almost nine years.
I...I don't know...
I suppose...
I was not a failure.
Were you?
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
I'm not taking him with me.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
You have?
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
What the hell is this?
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Kramer--
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
How many?
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Sure.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Huh.. .Hello?
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
And you have horses? You love horses.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
I have.
Soon.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
With much bloodshed.
I am afraid.
Holiness?
Me. First break of day.
Who am I?
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
Roughly five thousand men.
No. Not very big.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
I leave tomorrow.
Me?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
I have more men.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Yes.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
No.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
Go!!!
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
You take care.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
What?
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
Okay.  We're up at six.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Excuse me?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Ssssh!
You calm down!
Are we crazy?
Well...
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
If you get a safe shot...
He just came up screaming.
I wouldn't.
You talk to the married couple?
Not yet.
What kind of backup do we have?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
Are you alright?
A tooth?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Wild guess.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
No.
Myra.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Boy, is that smart...
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
I will... I promise.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
That wasn't me.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Why?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
You seem pretty sure of that.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Maybe they'll catch up.
No, I came because we need -
I didn't.
Reasonably so. Yes.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why? Do you know something about him?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Is it?
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
The death of my father.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
No. Tell me why.
Horses - and sheep...
I - ran away...
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
No. We just -
Later, listen, I'll -
Yes...! They were screaming.
Yes...
Time, Pilch! My move.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
Your "father"?
What?!
How did you learn English?
Much further?
Are we safe?
Maybe...
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
And my compliments to you...
Where will we go?
There was no letter.
"Some"?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
That is sedition! Treason!
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Excuse me. What did you say?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
This interview's over! The militia stays!
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
Was there such a thing?
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
It's got Hazy!
No!
What?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Okay, number 23's full.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Personal effects...
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Still bothering you?
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
Clear for pickup.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
It saw us!
Bitch!  Look what you did!
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Well?
It's a Samoan pub.
Like antiques.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
There are no others.
They were . . .
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Nope.
Can I help?
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Is he on his own?
Is that you, Dean?
I got the money to pay for 'em.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
There is only three of us here.
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
You what? What are you on about?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Tom?
For half a million?
Yes?
Well, perhaps you can help?
Doesn't sound very good to me.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
Leave your sister out of it.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
You think I can't learn that?
I'm sorry, sir.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
You really want to know, sir?
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Why don't you start with that?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Sergeant?
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Yeah.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Do I seem jumpy?
You look good--
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Same as they done in Mexico.
So how come you got into all this?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
I have a B average.
Homework?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Mikey--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
That's where he fell.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Senora Cruz?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
No.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
I got an idea what happened.
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
Yeah?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
He's all yours.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
People liked him.
Pilar--
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
How come it feels the same?
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
You're out early.
I'm going over to the other side.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Sure.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Name's Otis.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
You going to tell her?
Thirty-five bucks.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
What's the connection?
How did it go today?
He was the real thing, right?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Bad show last night?
And this Butterfield guy--
Are you finished with me?
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
What's the difference?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Yes.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
What's her problem?
She has no real grip on reality.
At birth.  I don't know you --
Harry D'Amour.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Didn't know you read minds.
Is that all?
You didn't try hard enough.
What is?
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
You'll do it?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Oh, hi.
I'm here for the week.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
It's Charlotte.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
I don't remember.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Oh, for her show?
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Where'd you grow up?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
How old is she?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
I'm sorry.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
It's just carpet.
Like Japanese food.
Hello?
Hello?
Evelyn Waugh?
What?
How'd it go today?
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
See you later.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
You never said anything to me...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I'm still shaking.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I found them in your file box.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
I can take care of myself.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
Something he said, just before...
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
So...what did you think of the tape.
Why did he try to kill me?
Trick him.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
Nothing yet.
What's the bible for?
Plenty of time.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Maya?  What do you mean?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
There weren't any voices.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
He could see me.
Thanks again for everything.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Ah, Mom.
What?
Hi.
Need any help?
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Huh?
Sorry.
My mouth is kinda dry.
Wait...
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Why not?
To do what you love.
Always on my ass, anyway.
No one's forcing her.
No.
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Well, what do you know.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
What do I have to do?
I don't have to do what you say.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
What's that?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Guess not.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
Forget Tonya Randall.
What are we playing for?
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
She understands.
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Hey, what's up.
The "man" again.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
What?
I don't think so.
Few days ago.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Hey.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Uh, your earring?
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Said he'd be home later.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
We need to talk.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
...what the fuck is this...?
What the fuck do you want?
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
OPEN THE DOOR.
You mind if I check things back here?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Bit messy.
You take cream or sugar?
It's not -- what's a 422?
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Let's make a deal.
You really use strong language.
-- you the resident here?
Diet Coke.
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Doc it's Janet.
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
And how much is braces?
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Go fuck myself?
Who are you gonna call?
...Lily...?
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
So boring, so useless --
Are you asking me that?
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
And that's what you've heard?
What am I doing?
Yeah.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
Does you mother still work?
And your father?
Are you asking me a question?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
Is he in pain?
Oh yeah.
It's interesting.
Are you lyin' to me?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
What the hell is this Marcie?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I won't.
Are you ok?
Are you alright?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
I don't think I want that.
It'll take the pain away.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
hey.
What about now?
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Can I come in?
What's MOW?
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Yeah.
Yes. What? Yes.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
Should be one-thirty.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Hi.
I have money to give you.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
What -- ?
I am preparing for a ball!
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
What had you to do with this, Mother?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Tomorrow.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Three days.
Three days??!!
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
Poor Phillippe!
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
No, not Louis!
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
I know.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Where are you going?
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
How did you know -- ?
One for all.  All for one.
Your Majesty...
I decided it this morning.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Eh?
Yes, yes, go on.
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
Magnificent valor...
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
What can I do for you?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Did you start out area six?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
He said he was following up some lead.
Speak of the devil.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
No -
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.
Where are you going?
You don't seem afraid of much.
Where am I going?
It was you who did the asking.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
Could he handle a direct contact?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
In thirty-five minutes.
How long do I have?
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
What do you want to do?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
What's one way?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
Tell me now.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
Will...?
What's being photographed?
Who is it?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
I want to see Lecktor now.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
He's right-handed.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What did he want?
He asked how you are.
Molly?
At the store. You doin' some good?
To do what?
No.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
I want to see you, too.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Will it keep them out?
Are you gonna kill him?
How did it happen?
You went in the apartment?
No.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Pictures?
Yes. I'd considered it.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Kevlar Second Chance.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
George, I hate sitcoms.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Those are my terms.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Excuse me, Andy...
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
"Burlesque"?
Er, yes.  Speaking.
So your name's not Gorsky.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
A -- a tourist.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
You don't know.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
Give me your phone.
Holy fucking shit!
Do you still want to meet?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
The Matrix?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
When?
This isn't real?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
How?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
That's why we're here.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Morpheus, I don't know --
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
How...?!
What's funny?
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Uh-oh...
What?
That's different.
Are you worried?
What did she tell you?
Are you all right?
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Do what?
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
How?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
That means it's good.
I gotta get the stuff.
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
'And with your spirit.'
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
No.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
What pipes?
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
It's all right.
Maybe, who knows.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Scumbag--
Sal!... fourteen street.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Look who's talking.
His wife?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Annie made them.
Yeah, but --
I thought you were buying my company.
Cold.
What an odd pairing.
In my sleep.
Did you just hear something?
Do you think I need a haircut?
Shall we adjourn?
I don't care.
Yours.
Certainly, Bill.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
'It's up to Joe'?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
I didn't know that.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Joe, I'm with Drew.
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Girlfriend?
Yes?
...No.
I love you in an evening gown.
We know so little about each other --
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Yes?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Joe --?
How about giving a guy a break?
Yes.
Are you sad, Bill?
Truly - uh - splendid.
About Susan?
I'll be the judge of that.
'Spooning'?
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Say again?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Joe, don't do this --
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Death!
You want me to be your guide --?
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
Where are you?  Are you there?
It's enough now.
Where are you?
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
How're you doing--?
Next week?
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
We're all here, Bill --
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Thank God.
What is it, Daddy --?
Where's Joe?
What's the way?
I've got to go --
Did I say something wrong?
Why?
21.
30.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
Shit. Wrong room.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
Interested in buying one?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Strip!
Take the money and walk away!
How do I know he did that to you?
Yes.
Did you?
What are you gonna do?
I'll go see him.
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Somebody's come. Already.
No!
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Calm down.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
My boyfriend told me about you.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
This is your car.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Why are you here?
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Happy now?
Like what?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Envelopes?							    *
This is a drug deal?!
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
It makes all the difference.					 *
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
No, you won't.
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Doing...?
They'll kill Gina.
It's a rip and a hit.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
I don't know.
Yes you do...
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
Do I need it?
When?
Then it don't work.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
No.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
This is Agent James Fujima.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
That's right.
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Who are you talking to?
What flowers?
What's it say?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Why?
What would you do...?
Meaning...?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
What the hell did you do?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
I ain't sleepy.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
For money for what?
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Where'd that come from?
Yeah, well, so?
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Listen, I gotta have money.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
You really want to do business?
What?
The Hilton.
Sure.
Where are the minefields?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Just what?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Billy, what's the matter?
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Weird shit...?
And a right.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Oh, that's gonna work.
Any luck?
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
Can we get this car there?
I pull.
We're no leaving you!
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Manny...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Please.
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Thought it was my week for that.
Honey, just leave it.
I heard how you talked to him.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Rub it on the windows!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Oh, come on, come on!
Gross. What is it?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
How long...?
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
If you wouldn't mind.
I don't have a title yet.
The phones are working?
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Misery's Return?
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
I want my pills NOW!
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
What?
Don't talk to me like that.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
I'm glad you like it.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Marcia, please.
That'd be a first.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Great.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
How do you that.
Magic...
Mmmm.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Nyah!
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
More like two-two point two million.
Exactly where is she?
Before we kill her or cure her..
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
And six billion in the world.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
-- his left jacket pocket.
I managed.
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
An idea, yeah.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
You mean it'll be difficult.
Something else?
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
That simple, huh?
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
She must still be on the property.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Satisfied?
Dont Jim.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Did we get it?
Talking's good, walking's better.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
There was nobody on the bridge.
Where were you?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is "they?"
Did they send you...Did they send you?
What are you going to do?
The message is for Job.
I didn't say that.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Yes.
Who else is left?
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
It's quite out of the question.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
We'll see.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Oh?  What's the problem?
And get a doctor.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
That's what we do isn't it?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Yes.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
You look tired.
I'm getting married.
Maybe.
Yes.
I'm going to marry him.
You are going to marry my brother?
Fast.
Seven years ago.
Stupid yourself.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
Because I have no Luck!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Me neither.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I've got you.
What?
What? What have we done?
Take it easy.
What did you do?
What did I do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
For what?
It's the best thing there is.
What do you want to do now?
Why not?
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Have Something.
I shouldn't.
I like this ring.
Alright. A month. In a month.
How was your plane ride?
Have you told her we're getting married?
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
No.
So we'll sell the house.
I don't wanna talk about it.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Oh.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
May I presume to ask you a question?
Sorry. That was rude.
Why do men chase women?
You knew that man?
I'm a little cold.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
That's my house.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
He's a plumber.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
What? What?
You were a tiger last night.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
You got me.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
I am your king!
NI!
NI!   NI!
And not too expensive.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
None shall pass.
You'll what ... ?
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Are you sure he's got one?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Ni, ni, ni!
Ni!
What with?
What?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
What?
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Well?
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I feel fine.
To find the Holy Grail.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your quest?
Well taken, Concorde!
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Father, lad.
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Herbert.
How?
Yes?
No, It's nothing!
Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!
Oh ... hello ...
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We must examine you.
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
I speak as I find, Archie.
What are you doing?!
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
I can't move to tidy.
Yeah.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
What did you say?
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Mama...
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Who'll bring it to me?
Do you?
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
Occasionally.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
I'm breaking no promises!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
I came as quickly as I could.
Is that not enough?
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
Why?
Why is he not here?
How do you stop The Screamer?
Dead?
Sick?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
No way.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
Okay.  It's West.
Shit...
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Yes...
But I don't understand...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
"Escape"?
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
They fired everyone.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
The Cowboy??
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
There is no problem.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
I'll speak to someone.
I agree with what you said...truly.
What did I say?
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Betty.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
No. I can't.
Was anyone hurt?
Diane?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
I had a dream about this place.
Oh boy.
Yeah, they showed me
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Not here...no thanks.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
What are you doing ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
I... I .....
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
A dragon.
Don't.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
One moment dear... 
What did you hear ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I was.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
The power went out in half the park.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
I'm talking to you asshole !
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Are you writing a poem?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
So you're saying...What are you saying??
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Of course.
Hi honey.
We have a baby?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
And she saved it.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
oh.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
Hi.
I guess you have.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Thanks
There's water in your bathroom.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Change my name.
I think it's cool.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
It's dangerous!!
Never heard of her.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
For the mini-bike fund.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
They're great.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
Phil for God sake.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Sort of?
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Shelly?
Let me hold him.
Really?
Do you know him?
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Danny?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
It's still available I hope?
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Deceased.
Harry, I really think she.....
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Can we see it from the back yard?
Pointing upwards Look...
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Dad?
The money?
Why?
Are they ready yet?
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
In the garage.
Are you sure about all this?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Sure.
Yes it is.
She's shy.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
I would.
What are they about?
Have you ever tried any?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Daddy??!?!?!
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
I'm allergic to it.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Oh no!  UUH.
If I do it, can we go?
Uh huh.
No.
Hmmmm, interesting.
What?
What?
What?
Got it!
Come on, let's go.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
He likes her better than me.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Okay, okay.
Say something it's too quiet.
Well, let's spit on it.
Would you think of me?
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Try less appropriate.
Elmer's Glue?
I give.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
And loving him means loving all of this.
And the answer was so simple.
Jesus, we're trapped!
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
He'll see right through it.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
I think he's been fired.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
Well, sure.
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
You're not eating.
You miss her, huh?
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
No accents today.
I'm up against a deadline.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
What's up?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Almost three.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Maybe it's happy there.
What do you have to buy?
What?
Is there food?
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
He knows better.
What?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Third party?
You know better than that.
Howdy.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?
No.
Next you'll be sick.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Does their hair fall out?
When did you start singing?
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
No, I don't.
I'm here.
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Oh.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
What National TV...?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Come on back to bed.
No, we never did that
You do?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What kind of pies do you have?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Naw, she don't mind.
Yeah.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
I can appreciate that.
Lobotomy Bay?
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Says the United States of America.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
Yeah baby.
Through the power of the simple word---
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Three.
And me.
Don't call my men assholes.
It sure is.
Boy - you hear me?!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
I said: Cut it out!
I know.
Where was that?
Okay.
Okay.
Guess so.
Any other family?
Yes, aren't you?
No.
I like a place with lots of life.
How about another beer?
Hell!
How d'you mean?
Get out of here!
You almost got into trouble back there.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Are you married?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
How old is your boy?
Okay, I guess.
Don't push me, Duff.
I don't want to hurt you.
You jivin' me?
What about your boy?
I keep thinking about him.
Don't, Duff.
They won't.
No point fixin' it!
How about a drink?
No.
Great.
Want me to hold the light for you?
I said, she's in great shape.
How often is that?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Guess it's never been easy.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
I understand.
I know.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
What's an A.I.
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Alright. Let's talk business.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Dixie McCoy
Prepping your trip.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
What are you talking about?
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
What elders?
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Jah guides us.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Right...
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Who got you into this?
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
It'll flatline your ass.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Why should I want to meet him.
I'm going in.
On a good run... yeah.
Too late?
Won't that mean you're dead?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Well, do you?
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
What is this?
Transitioned?
How many times have I fired her?
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
You've done five of my ideas.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
But I don't want it straightened out.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
What if I say no?
Oh my god.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Josie Grossie.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
This seat taken?
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Josie, you look Rufus.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
I can't help it.
Just what?
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Where are you going?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Come back here!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
Where's Jesse?
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
How come?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I figured you might like some help.
What's all this.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Disappointed?
About not finding any bogey men?
What is it?
I'm not hungry.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
Okay, I guess.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
Morning.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Research.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Oh God.
You're late.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Who would know where they were hidden?
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
My God.
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm not listening.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Films mainly.
Really, no.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Floppy, huh?
Let's go in.
You abide by rules like that?
I'm sorry.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Who was Gilda?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Yes.  What do you think?
What happened?
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Any bit in particular?
Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
So it could have been neither of them?
Do you ever masturbate?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Oh God no.
No, sir.
No, sir.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Try 'Flintstone.'
Oh my God...  Hello.
I wouldn't go outside.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Are you sure you...?
Bad news.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Tell us about it...
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Let me get on your shoulders.
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
Yeah, where we going?
Ya know what, Fred?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Twenty-five dollars.
Giving up?
I'm busting outta this place.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I said out!
Gimme a cigarette!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
How are you feeling?
I'm afraid not.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
He's a patient, Rose...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
He's in charge.
I'm sure you will.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Tha's your problem.
At this hour?
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
You're sure...
Let's find a telephone.
Yes.  We did.
Who's dying?
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
You...
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
My name's 
Damon Bradley...
You said whatever it was you would understand.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
So?
Hey--
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
There's no such thing.
Really?...
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Hello.
Really?
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't believe in statistics.
No.  He smokes.
But somebody wrote those songs.
So?...
No.  He's never asked me.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Come on, it's not so bad.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Because you were afraid to fly.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
Are you sure?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
You expecting somebody you know?
Larry bought himself cologne?
What did you say to her?
Is he looking at us?
Packing.
Joan Collins stayed here.
Maybe I can change him.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Kate is that you?
And you are?...
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
She what?!
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
That's right... .
Boss loader!
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
I'll get home all right now.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
I'd better go in.
How do you like it?
Were you really a prize fighter?
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
His racket?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
What are you going to do?
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
I just told the Father.
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Every one of 'em... .
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
Where you goin'?
Someone else c'n take your confession.
But you've got to listen to me.
About Edie?
I want to see you, Terry.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Down to the wire?
So help me God!
Never will be much too soon.
You looking for me?
Raise a hand to me and... .
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Terry?  What do you want?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Forty-five bills.
Count this.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
I was only talkin' to her.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Be careful!
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
A symbol, Master.
She was?
There are others.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
The time...is short.
You know better than that.
Then why do you shake so?
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I said not as a rule.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Till they got busted.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
How long you talk to her?
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
They look like plain old rocks.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You're gonna use a ram?
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
I could walk out of here.
Ironic, isn't it?
Quite a mess.
I bet.  How much?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
That's funny.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Faye Dunaway.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It smelled.
She did, huh.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
Why are you mad?
You just did, for Christ sake.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
Okay.  How many going out?
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
It's a little late for me.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
What's to think about?
You don't remember me, do you?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
You're not?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Really?
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You not with probation, one of those?
Here?  In this house?
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Thanks, Dad.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Oh, he's moved out?
You were talking in your sleep.
Not at all.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
I don't have any idea.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
What?
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
I think he must've fell in.
...the fuck is this...
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
That's me, Sir.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
You liked that?
Sir?
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
They ready, Earl?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I didn't mean it.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Danny...
I can't make it.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Then wh-where do we land?
Well sure, Colonel --
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
It must of been a convincing letter.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
I have'na been able ta --
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Hello, Lilla!
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Welcome to the singles scene.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
They're waiting. Come on.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Just what you underlined.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
What do you know about classical music?
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I just can't trust you anymore.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Just take a look at it. 
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
You don't?
Don't you get along with your parents?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
It's Charlie!
Damn that Charlie I
Thank God for that.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
He'll win.
Does everybody have to hear?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
I don't feel very festive.
Where have you been?
I'm just happy to see you.
And the butter.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
What a great kite.
What's inside?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Hi, Richard.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Like what?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
That's Renee alright.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What's wrong?!
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
It's weird...
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
K-R-O-one.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Aren't you giving an exam?
One hour!
We're not skipping this treatment.
I'm not going to close the--
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Thanks, Charles.
Thanks for coming in.
Take it easy, Walter.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Client of yours?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Continue.
I buy that.
Thanks for your time.
Find a lawyer?
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Not bad.
A regular all-American guy?
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
No.
In some situations.
Yes.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Were you recently promoted?
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Leave that.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
Since when?
Joe?
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
You taught him a lesson.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Charles...
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Don't wanna miss this.
Entered our minds.
What do you see? Riddick?
You sure you can keep --
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
I can't....I can't....
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
I would try for them.
There....
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Let's just be sure.
How many?
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
We aren't completely stupid.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Company's not here, is it?
Owens!
Some prophet guy?
What?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
Very big beads.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Not if I'm the one.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Where does the river lead?
Now, just a minute --
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Any particular reason?
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
What happened?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
Landon! Send a last signal.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Climb off me, will you!
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
With one of them.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Tell him to pull back!
Then there is another jungle?
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Would you like to come along?
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Like you, I find it difficult.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
What?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
I got one...
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Feel good?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Nah...
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
These two holes are yours...
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Indefinitely?

What's the matter?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
No, please.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
And do you amuse the guests?
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Bad?
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
You don't know who he is?
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
Killaine...
Do you have to leave the note?
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Do you think I was faking?
Yes, Miss.
Ale. I don't mind.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
I expected nothing else.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
You asked for it.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
Got the information on you?
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
The usual grind.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
A couple of hours.
It could have been an accident.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
That's not enough.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
So?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Why should I mind?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
What went wrong?
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Terrific.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
And some of that.  Sorry.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Blas and epicene.
Now, top secret file.
It's shit.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
Don't point it at James!
Ah, Susy, it...
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Don't you gamble?
What's this?
We're wasting time.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Wild ride, huh?
You never were...
Sir?
Surf conditions okay?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
I know where they're going.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
What are you talking about?
Those are cold.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
No way, old buddy.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
That's over the border, General.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We can reach an understanding on this.
You've got a lot of nerve.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Yes.
That's ridiculous.
The price just went up to ten.
Stolen?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
For the whole night?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Let's talk some more first.
And why do you say that?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
I sell them.
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
This isn't a date.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
You still mad at'm?
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
You won't.
What if someone tries to steal it?
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Business.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
You're being ridiculous.
Give me twenty minutes.
He... he just does.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
What kind of school?
Yeah, what?
What's your name?
But what if they serve soup?
Miss Vivian --
You're not accompanying him to New York?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Having a good time, Vivian?
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
Rest, Highness.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
I fear I'll never see you again.
But what if something happens to you?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
He's really very short on charm.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
-- Fezzik, please --
You've been mostly dead all day.
I brought you a special present.
A book?
-hold it, hold it-
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Do you want me to go on with this?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Westley's only faking, right?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Sire.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Now?
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
-- all that I have and more please --
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Because I know something you don't know.
You're amazing!
I must know.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Go in, get after her!
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
You're just stalling now.
-- get back, witch --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
I have hurt your feelings.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Assume away!
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
I already have.  Come on.
What kind now, Leo?
Maybe you're happy.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
To failure!
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Max, I...
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Come on.  Let's get going.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
I shall count the minutes.
Wagner...
Wagner...
Nietzche...
Hindenburg...
The Blue Max...
I told them we invaded England.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
No. At least I don't recall.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No.
And when she left, she never came back.
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Let's all talk about Mary.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
What difference does that...
Lila.
Is something wrong?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
I was getting to that!
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
Arbogast said...
Sam! Why call when we can go?
You going to wait here for me?
Sorry.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Don't miss your plane.
I'd like to.
I've caused you some trouble.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You eat like a bird.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Wait a minute!
Norman took a wife?
I'll get your bags.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
No-
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
That's it. You get it quick.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
You here again?
Yes!
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
There's no hurry. It's early.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
I won't let you say that!
I'd call it stupid at any time.
The body of Joan Gale!
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
That's what I said.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
That happens to be the truth.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
You did miss --
I'm heading out of town.
Of what?
Dysfunctional --
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Yes?
Is Rose here?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Well, some fiend might.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
I don't know.
Yeah, he's still up there.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
But how would you find him?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
What did you say, Brother?
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
I think Daddy suspects.
She's watching the car again?
They're discussing it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
She's putting the titty back.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
I am ahead of you.
What?
Oh. Did you say something?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
She already told you, she doesn't know.
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Got yourself up?
You're so sweet.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
What's the use, there ain't none.
Well. What kinda job is it?
Mine.
Your baby?
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Took your time gettin' here.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Yes, dear, what is it?
What's the matter with him?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
You shouldn't litter.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
That wasn't my fault.
"A.D."
Yeah.
What about him?
I can't believe we're stealing.
No, we're stealing.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
You know... you could say thank you.
You think this is so easy?
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
What... ?  Not you too?
That's not true.
Let's get this thing done.
What the hell's his problem?
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
As you wish.
Luke!
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Someone who loves you.
I...
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
What are you telling them?
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Ugh!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
There is no conflict.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Told you, did he?
Certainly not!
He might be.  I don't know.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Yes Brad.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Hello.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
What a guy
Was all I had to say
Free to try and find a game
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Looks quiet, y'know.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
...I suppose.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
No, I don't belong here.
...What?
Don't want weak legs.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Is everything all right?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
No... I can't!
Why?
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Hear she's retarded.
Don't like yours neither.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
Bob.
That's it, I'm broke.
Yeah.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
What?
What'd you say?
Stuff it, man!
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
I said, how ya feelin'?
How old?
Yeah, Kayo.
Yeah.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Whatta you get outta this?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Looks, huh?
Hey --
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya always in a bad mood --
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
What's ya sister like to do?
It don't matter.
What can I do about it?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Do you feel you have a chance?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
A tweeting bird?
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Sounds like singin'.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
How did you get onto Doom?
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
What's with the dip?
What the hell is that?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Yeah?
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Romeo! Romeo!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
But new struck cuz.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
'Tis he.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Juliet!
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
[Within] Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
So thrive my soul--
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Meaning, to court'sy.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
What is?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Are you alright?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You sure about this?
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Don't do it, Sam!
Shut up!
What do you mean?
And more importantly --
I don't have it with me...
There is one other thing...
Really?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
So what is it you want to know?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
Who's they?
As in, they own it?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
Lovely, isn't it?
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You know him?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Business keeps you on the road?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Ready to roll, partner?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
I've got one condition.
Shhh!
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
You're crazy.
It's gonna be o.k.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
It's too late...
And you're solid on that?
Just take it in stride.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Shut up, Jesse.
What's that?
What for?
Has he?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Hi.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
OK.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
He's not, he's...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I don't believe it.
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Dwayne.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Uh...C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Sure.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
You'd do this to me?!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Anything in it?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
This isn't right...
What the hell is that?
Invitation, please.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
So tell me what you know.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Those girls drove off because of you.
No.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
Well, hurry up.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Good at what?
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
IT IS CRAZY!
How do you know he's our man?
How do you know?
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Slow down, baby.
What?
Well we're not friends.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
What's a Chinese heaven?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Yes.
New York City?
First class.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
What is your name?
He stole my wheel!
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
A little.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
It was not my intent --
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
No.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
I'm sorry, Lee.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Nobody touches me.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
Yes.
Hello.
I do.
I would like one of my people to help.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
It's hurting.
Bob's in a hurry.
Look, he's running after her.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
I don't know.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Lost!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
Yes, I did.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
Where?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
He's going to be the pastor?
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
A harmless joke.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
I hate boats.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Walter, I'd love to --
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
You go.
What?
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
What?
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Becky?
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
No, I'm not. 
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
Mom, we already...
Hi.
It's me?
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
I don't think I could really describe it.
You don't like the one he was now?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Hey, my plate is full.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
When's the latest time you were out there?
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
You'll find out.
What is it?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
It's a spice rack.
It's never happening again. Right?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Jonah!
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Have you seen my wallet?
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
You said we could go to New York.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
No.
No.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Hi.  Sam?
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
You're kidding --
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
He's good at it.
I read the same article...
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
To the mine?
Over my dead body.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Yes.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
Be still ...
Alone?
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
You know I don't think that.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
Now that's down-right insulting.
Everything go?
Yeah.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
It gets me through the day.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
It's me.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Colette, go.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
You on a roll?
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
I think on account of his nose.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
But...I've seen you.
When? When did you ever see me use?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
Crank or glass?
You're serious?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
You want to do this some other time?
No last name?
I was trying to score some dope.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
What?!
What's that smell?
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Really?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
He ain't Wade.
Where?
Watching.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Say what, Cap'n?
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
How about that jeep?
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
Glad of it.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Pass.
It seemed appropriate.
What is it?
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Sure, you got one?
Caen?
You get a translator, Captain?
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
Three for three.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Yeah.
What do you think?
Uh, oh.
I'm listening, sir.
Huh?
Why's that?
No, sir.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Who cares?
Damn fool.  Sir.
We know.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What's the profile?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
That's unlikely.
That's just so embarrassing.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
I am.
Lloyd is doomed.
Wait a minute.
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Morning honey.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Morning.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
I'm fine.
Did he ever get rough with you?
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Honey!
But I found the money.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
So you're monumentally busy?
Actually, I think that I...
I'll go.
Whoa.
Thank-you.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Sure I do.
Job?  Being a great date.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Yeah.
You think so?
Okay, bye.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
It did?
No, no.
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
You're freaking out here man.
No.
What?
Thanks Lloyd.
Very talented.
So what's up?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Lloyd.
Oh boy.
Yeah.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Oskar, please -
Luck.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
What's going on?
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
What do I got for you?
That's great.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
So I'll talk to him about it.
Pots and pans.
Christmas presents.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
Eight hundred, give or take.
Have you checked the...
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I did that.
Did it?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Where is Sidney's father?
No way.
Or it found us.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
You have every right to be upset.
I never meant to imply...
Can we turn the light on?
They're roomates.
Let's go.
What do you mean?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Gotta.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
How many guys they have on you?
What do you want?
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
Melinda McGraw?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
Thanks.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Always.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
You're not a detective.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Roman that's not the line.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
How do I know their voices are --
I'm sorry, your voice.
Who the fuck is this?
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Are you serious?
Why did you kill my mother?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
What number is this?
Do I?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Do you like scary movies?
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Don't do this. I can't...
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Have you contacted the bureau?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Where is she?
What's the delay?
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
I have no idea.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
No you didn't.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
I'm not worried.
I bet he's pissed.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
What am I? The beer wench?
How's that?
No, I haven't heard.
Already.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
I... I don't follow.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I realize that.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Is that clear?
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
What about sports?
Punishing.
Forced what?
This is the one thing.
I know.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Nothing.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
And so what?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
How much money do you have?
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
What are you talking about?
He's preaching.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
This painting...
Oh... um, William.
I want to have children.  It's just...
How's California?
What, Ben?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
No sir...pleasure.
You all right, sergeant?
Dunno...Seems so.
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
You want us to fire a shot if...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
What?
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Not no more.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Was your niece about their age?
I got your boy killed.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
Well I ain't one of 'em!
You crazy?
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Do you know where fuse box is?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Hello.  Can I help you?
Ellen Straub.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
You didn't tell her!
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Hammer?
Well, look here!
WillWhere is Mercutio?
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
You are a gentleman.
Yes.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Interesting.
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
On my mother's side the Ardens
It's a comedy.
There's never any
Very well.
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
No, it will turn out well.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Is she obedient?
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
Oh my lady, my love!
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Then I will go with you.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Will you read it for me?
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
It is only ours you can know.
Does she say so?
Your aunt?
All right, just a few questions.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
About what?
Alex, I don't have the time --
He's still here.
No, not that.
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't hear this.
Finished.
But they know.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
I don't know anything about it.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Cover it?
Are you recording it?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Yes, thanks.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
For the flat.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
What I am.
Don't look?
No.
OK.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Hello. Hello.
No.
Leave him alone.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
What?
Of course.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Of course.
No, three. Who said there were four?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Why do you want a room here?
Is this what they always look like?
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Two hundred pounds?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Oh, him. Well, he died.
A priest who dies.
No.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
The human condition.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
You can tell by the intonation.
Don't you like her?
Yes, but... I thought...
What do you expect me to do about it?
My keys.
You're late, George.
You're looking great, baby.
I hope she's all right.
But aren't you...
She what?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Are you in love with her?
It isn't?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
No thanks.
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Well, are you?
Yeah, it is.
Great.
I guess not...
I've got heads here, Norman.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
George... how about Felicia?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Baby...
-- we can't now.
Sammy's?
-- yeah.
-- sure.
-- yes, you --
-- It's Malone's.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What with?
-- yes, George.
That's too bad.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
George, I don't --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
How?
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
I am?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I want your feelings about it.
When?
Neither do I, baby.
I know, honey.
Ha, ha.
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Where did this come from?
What do you wanna know for?
Did you?
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
When?
Sorry, honey, I...
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
This really ought to be layered...
Well, what?
Now wait a minute...
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Want a drink?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.

Yeah.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
A soap?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Steve?
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
You and your touchy investors.
-- Yeah, honey...
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That's right.
Why don't you ask for another one?
-- sort of a boyfriend?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- there's not much room --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Are you married?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
How's it going, Doc?
No, Dad.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay...oh!
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny?
Oh,
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Yes, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
She eh... interferes.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Sure.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Bill, how do you do?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
It's good to see you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.
Of course I am.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Stop it!
Not for me.
I'm intrigued.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Blue. This blue.
Where's Mom?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
No.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
A tracer. You'll like it.
You want to know what I think?
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
I think I hear it!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
His ashes?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Who are all these people?
I'm getting experience.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Oh my Lord!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
What did He say?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
It has come to pass.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
A what?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Is this all the food I get?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
A vote?
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Then one day they find you.
You won't even tell us?
Who are you guys?
Get her!
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
An... entertainer?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
She's a nun, Vince.
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
We both missed.
What the hell are you doing?
You must have missed your mark.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
All I saw was their lantern.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
There is no such thing as magic.
These scars.  How did you get them?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
What are you on about?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What?
Blood.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Yes, actually.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
The Horseman.  Yes.
May I see my mother?
She is guilty.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Thank ye.
Yeah, they's good all right.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Leave.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
No sir.
You like that Vaughan?
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
What's in your bag?
What's all them books?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Yeah, I did.
Well, I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
All right then.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Oh, jackin' off?
So it died when it come out?
It was fun, anyhow.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Naw.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I reckon.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Yes ma'am.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
No thank you.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Are you closed?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
It's kind of overwhelming.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Did you ever go back to see her?
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
What's this?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
I almost got married once.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
What is this, some kind of joke?
So I can get my job back.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Benefits?
The name is Cyrus Cole.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
In Manhattan?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Eight-thirty.
How long have you been here?
Where did you get that thing?
Why don't you go to the police?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Celebrate? What for?
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
That money is my whole future.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
It is.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And the last...?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
How long you have this detail?
That's when he fell.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
We don't let go, you s...
You always run with the well open?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
I don't think so.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Okay, doll.
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Beat it, Buster.
Thank you ever so.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Okay. 
You're right, Joe.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Down, Daphne!
Men?
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
What are you doing with my flowers?
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry - there's another problem.
Oh.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
Good night, honey.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Stay as long as you'd like.
No, no.
What did you say?
I'm not that sick.
What's the surprise?
Here you are, Sugar.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
We don't have to run.
I always did.
Brand new.
What's wrong with us?
You don't say.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
I'm not surprised.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
You must be quite a girl.
We can have it altered.
I don't care.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
What's the job?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
We'll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Rough?
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Yeah.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Glasses?
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
That must be it.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
- riding to hounds -
What theory?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
It's all right for a bachelor.
Harmless - how?
Talk about sad.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Daphne -
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Good evening, sir.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Big joke!
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Yes, sir.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
What for?
It was such a long time ago.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Whats going on with you two?
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
She did?
Ill just check into a hotel.
Hey, you!
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
Six thousand, right?
Who are they?
You stand on your tiptoes.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
What?! No, no. You cant--
You want I nut him in the boat?
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
Its complicated, Dad.
You don't live around here, do you?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Uh huh...
Here it is, right here.
That's where we come from first?
What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
No, Miss Johnson...
Can you swim?
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Well, looka here...
We didn't find Sounder yet.
He'll show up one day.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
What's that, son?
Sunday...
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
What's in there, David!?
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
You got two shirts on?
Did you see Daddy?
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
What's wrong, Nathan?
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Come, I'll take you home.
Tired.
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
Okay.
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Mph rmpmh rm.
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
What's going on, Chef?
Look at that!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Viva la Resistance.
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mrph?
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Who is it?
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
That was sweet!
Nowhere.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
What is Terrance and Phillip?
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Oh, you are such a maroon!
AGH!
Who's my cream puff?
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
You didn't?
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
It can't be.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Weren't you down in the dining room?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
We're going to die.
That's right.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
He certainly is polite.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I don't know what we're facing.
You're ready for the real thing?
Yeah?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
I'm not going with you.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Thank you.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
I'm homesick.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Can I get you something for the road?
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Hey, you still here?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
You know, Elvis bowled.
Sure, Sid.
They suspended me for 100 years.
Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
What's it look like to you?
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
How's that?
Buzz Fazeli.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
Why would you help me?
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
Fantastic! What talent.
132, 154.
I'm a bowler.
Do you know where they're taking him?
What does he do?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Nothing.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You told Junior that we did it.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
How do you get this thing down?
I feel sick.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
Very professional.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Open it, Captain!
Norman!
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
But she's --
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
What team?
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
Going active.
What caused it?
Any sign of Harry?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
It's chipped.
Gimme a report, I want --
Sir, about leaving --
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Norman!
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What do you mean -- not normal?
Beth.
Where did you get this?
Why should I go?
But I don't know how --
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
What's the matter?
Still clear?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
He translated it wrong.
I don't know.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Your watch.
Do you fear them?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Beth --
Beth, stop it!
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Just in time, too.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?  I'm not --
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
When did it come across?
I'm not being defensive.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
Norman?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
That's right.
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
What is it, Harry?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
But it's impossible.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
What report?
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Squint harder.
The creature?
You seen my suitcase?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Who's going to pay me then?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
Is that good or bad?
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Who are you anyway?
They use the Bogan Force.
Are you all right?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Yes, sir.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
There are only three or four left.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
Why didn't you say so before.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
No!...
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
You rich kids... are all the same !
Sir, no, sir.
Did you read her mind ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Who ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
None at all... We won.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Who cares ?
Do you mean it ?
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
What ?
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Oh, my, what's that ?
Mr. Rasczak.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Best in the Fleet !
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
Let's go.
Not a problem.
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Disclose the information.
They have repressed the Creator.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Yes.
By the Creator.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
I quit.
Yes.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
You get what you pay for.
I understand...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
Yes...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
I thought you had Play Practice.
What are you doing down there?
It's for your finger.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
What've you got?
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...yes.
How's your star?
What is it all about?
After Drama Group.
Hi!
Who is this person that you've found?
I'm sorry.
Courthouse back in town.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
He's on the ph...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Fourteen year old girls.
This horse is booked.
They think it's your First Wife...
Bobby, don't say anything.
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with...
What...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Who is it raped you?
I wasn't in the car.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
I love Jewish men.
Claire, when did you...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
I...
An artist of your caliber...
That's cor...
Did she throw up?
Why not?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
He didn't have to tell...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
What?
The writer.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I'm very sorry I...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I hurt my finger.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
<u>Siddown</u>!
I didn't say anything to them.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
How was your flight?
What's in all the bags?
It's just a formality.
<u>Pay</u> her.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
It takes all kinds.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Bet you did.
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
I said...
Not with my mouth open.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
This'll work, huh?
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
Here.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
This is my daddy's house --
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
You know, this horse smells really bad.
...your hating me.
Cos she loves you.
IS THAT YOU?
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
I'm fine, ba...
How do you know?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Rache says it's from you.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
It's not good enough.
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
I'm here.
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Not to me.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
What did you do?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
However many.  It's not enough.
I'm sorry, I just...
Jackie?
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
I don't, but...
You're a cross-dresser.
Moi?
Oh, my God.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Ben never mentioned it.
You'll learn.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
For what?
But?  But what?
I told her I loved her.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Out! Leave the table!
I'll be your guest!
My Jesus
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
The camerawork's nice.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Fuck!
I dunno.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Gee, you're home early!
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Any books you like to read for fun?
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Anything I might know about?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah. But not any more.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Whoopee.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I said I'll lead.
What do you mean?
What do you think?
What happened?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Because I'll be firing at them.
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
So, what are we looking at White?
What the hell is it, anyhow?
What!
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Are we adrift--
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
What is your name, young lady?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Yes?
That's a very wise deduction, General.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
No, sir.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Ask away, Major.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
I guess so.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Right.
Go on, Major.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Do you think we'd cheat?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
I presume the planes are armed?
Why can't you cancel it?
Then there's no chance for recall?
Have you tried the recall again?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Speed?
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
What does it look like?
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Check target approach.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
What happened?
Recall what mistake?
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Yeah, I guess.
What's it about?
Your a nurse?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
No, no.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Okay, okay.
Fuck it!
No, I'm not worried.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
Erica is in the van back there.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Come on man.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Shit.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Whoa!
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Yeah!
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Yeah. So, what about you?
Oh, yeah?
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
That chick, Erica?
They let you out?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
No.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
That's right.
Was that supposed to be me?
About what?
Name one.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
You do.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
You're unbelievable.
What?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
So who are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Hey, where's Erica?
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Like?
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Would I get paid?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Whatever.
If you hit me...
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
The fuck not?
What?!
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
I'm in, too.
Cleo!
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
And they get caught!
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
Jack...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
That was gas, Sweetie.
I'm sorry.
Let me explain something...
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Shut up.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
Bullets.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
They could kill you.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
More proof God's a guy...
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
What's wrong with it?
It's from hunger.
Name dropper.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Why, you sweet kid.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
With a wildly beating heart.
What teacher?
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
He thinks it could be made into something.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
I tell you this is half sold.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
We're engaged.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I just don't.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Why did she call me?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Yeah?
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Where do you live?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
They've come for my car.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
What's that?
What are the notes?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Go away.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I ran into some people I knew.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Good night.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Good.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
Uh-huh?
How is she?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
But which one?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
And now?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Did anybody notice you?
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What's a tree?
Where is Earth?
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
That was meant for me!
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
What's it like?
That horrible woman!
There is a way.
Why?
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Brad Wilson.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him --
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
Who?
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
Uh-huh.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Nope, but --
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
First paycheck?
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
Who gets it, the company?
Say what?
Black or regular?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Is this blackmail?
Fair's fair.
Yeah? How's it look?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
There's no rush.
The picture looks blurry.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
But the other night...
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Where's the light switch?
Oh, Superman!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
It could make weather!
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Anybody been hurt?
Lois, what are you doing?
Actually, yes.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Maybe I could try --
Maybe you wanted to.
Let's go to my place.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Everything on it?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
What??
Gee. But --
You'll have to pack quickly.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
It's beautiful.
Why didn't you go before we left?
Artemis? Do you read me?
Now This I want to hear.
Where?
North.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
Constantly.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
You are master of all you survey.
I really don't think . . .
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Go on . . .
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
What was that about?
This wasn't in the plan.
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Albert!
It was hot, yes.
Lois isn't here?
Your bookie?
He may have a gun!
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
You're not the only one.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You think he's for real?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Mr. Romance...
You're happy, aren't you?
They stop for nothing.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Two.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Twenty-four.
Lois, the kickback story...
You've got me? Who's got you???
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Oh.
Thirty-five.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Sort of.
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
But you said...
What happened?
Alison.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
You're leaving.
You believe that?
Why?
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
And what's that?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
It's interesting.
Nicole!
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
That's the local bar?
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
What do they do?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Perfect.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
DADDY!!!
News?
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
We do.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
No.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
You remember that much?
Why were you scared?
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
Why not?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
You remember this?
What's so funny?
What took so long?
It's okay.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Why, has he bothered you before?
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
Why are you trembling, dear...?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You print them, don't you?
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
I know Steve.  No.
Can't hurt...
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
What does that mean - integrity?
Don't go wild, Sidney.
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
Could this be that boy?
Bribing me again?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
Back?
Don't you know who that man is?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Yes, but why?
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
J.J., if you think -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
That is one of my mission parameters.
What?
Does it hurt?
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Why do you cry?
Dyson.
Drive faster.
We don't have much time.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Eating is eating... and...
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
I guess so, sir.
What the hell are they doing?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Mine's the Eleventh.
No. Ours was damaged.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Who?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
I wish to say something.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Yes, I know who he is.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I don't understand what you mean.
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Who's he?
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
Reese...you got a first name?
I caught one, back there.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Good field-dressing.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
That's not my mission.
What's that?
He'll find us, won't he?
Someone?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Here, drink some of this...
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
I could fight you on this.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
What's with him?
Alright... okay...
Home.
Why not?
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
They'll love that.
Never did catch your name.
That's classic.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Right.  Call me Christy.
What are you doing here?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
What are you doing?
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I have to get to the airport...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Big family... small?
No.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Never better.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Trust me.  Call that number.
It's them.  They did this.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Do you know how to change a tire?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
I'll call.  I really will.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
It's different every time.
And if nothing's lacking?
I need the police.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
The Hinchberger wedding.
Anything wrong... ?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
You're joking.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
And what kind of sleeper?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
And those are Luke's and mine.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
It's not going to hold your weight.
I didn't do it.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Sorry.
All right...
And then what happened?
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Is she asleep?
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Why'd she kill herself?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
That's why we're here.
No.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
What'd you come back for, babe?
It's not a knock.
What kind of food?
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
What's the matter?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
Lookin' good.
Eduardo.  Rama.
I didn't expect anyone.
Y'what?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
What's so fucking funny?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Too easy?
What post office?
Same.
Well, those are the breaks.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Why did you come here?
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Disappointed.
How'd you manage that, then.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Right.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Not that I recall.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
How far?
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
Where is he now?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Makin' trouble for someone?
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Where is he, then?
You've made it ... brighter.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Is he here?
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Ah.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Yes, Ann?
Who?
Yeah.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
That right.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
...You bring a check?
Cash.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
How much to they want, Dave?
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
I don't know what's going on. I--
I took Doris's keys.
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
Sure you don't need one?
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Yeah.
Huh?
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Second chair.
Anything missin'?
Why not?
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I don't want to scare people.
What's the combination?
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
The body?
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
How big is the sub-basement?
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Dr. Green has to see you!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
What's that?
I hope you liked it.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
They've got something.
Stop!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't understand.
How did you know that?
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
What happened?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
Gone.
Hide quickly!
Help someone!
You smell that?
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
Thank you.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
You think she'd go through with it?
You take Japanese.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Now.
Yeah, what happened?
Marlon--
How about them?
I told you I can't.
What're we doing here, Truman?
Yeah...
Stay where you are!
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
I don't know--
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
--What the hell are you talking about?!
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
How are you, Mother?
How's your hip?
--Darling--
They're going to stop me talking to you.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
What am I doing here?
I need your clothes, Byers.
You've been back to Dallas?
Yes.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
No, they don't.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
How's that?
You follow me out here for a reason?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
You know my work?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
That would be my guess.
I've been using you?!
Jesus, Mulder...
Scully?
Get dressed, Scully.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Evidence of a massive infection.
I don't know.
Mulder --
How was it contracted?
You think they went left?
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Mulder --
Been where?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
What about you?
Our vaccine may have no effect!
Did we go sailing?
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Yes mother.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
Little boy?!  That's him!
COME ON!
Yep.  Eloped.
They're hungry.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
No.
What about the cat?
Here he is.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
...at all.
Harry?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
I wish I knew.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Nichts danke. Kein.
That's the reason.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
No.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Yes.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
What?
...to him.
Miss Schmidt.
...in the morning.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
It's a military hotel.
...excuse me.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
What about?
Zane Grey.
Who?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
As long as they can use you?
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...the best way one can, you know.
Coffin?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Could he have been conscious?
I was told that he did not die at once.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He didn't want to get involved.
What else did he tell you?
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Excuse me.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
I'll share something with you.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Traveler.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
So?
So how many miles do you think it is?
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
But he has been there, off course.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
I don't care about money.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Which is what?
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Oh, yeah... 
Fuck that.
No, I think you shouldn't.
They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Of course they're Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't think you know what you are.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
No!
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
From the Rhineland originally.
So what Jew would you kill first?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
What are you doing here?
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Which one were you aiming at?
That's all we've got left.
Not too fast.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
I can tell....
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Do you think I...
Eat shit....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
But your man isn't quite a God!
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
You know each other?
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Where did you two meet?
Congratulations.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
... It's a comfortable place.
The Mamma's there too.
Is it a poem?
What else is there?
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
How do you know that?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Dollars.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Great!
Well, what are they?
Everything about what?
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
Yes.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
How are you?
No... tell me.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
It's my apartment.
... And those?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
What!?
Yes Esther.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Mom! We're eating!
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
What's wrong with him?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I sleep it off.
I don't know.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
I'm sick.
Rosita  I have wondered -
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's right, of course.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
More or less.
It could be a man.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
No.
Not! I tell you. No!
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Yes. The lipstick.
That's easy. Me.
No  not yet.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
When will they be back?
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Excuse me?
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
Black suits you.
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
You splendid bastard...
Should I?
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
To get me killed...?
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
The word for those things is croissants.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
A criminal?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Im calling about the puppies.
Yes... Good, good...
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
You sure you passed on my message?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Should I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Okay. Recommended...
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Vous tes Franais?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
What is?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
At what time will you be available?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men, so...
He just said he had good reasons.
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Los Angeles?
Uh-huh.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Cinq cents.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Alors quoi?
Five seconds. Then you die.
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.
If he had, youd be dead.
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Mossad?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Whats that? A word?
That's a good idea, sire.
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
And I would like to see a priest.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
What did the king say?
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
We want her burned as a witch!
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
But where are you going to be?
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
Who are you?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Yes...
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
You will??
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
If there was, I didn't see it...
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
Do you know how to count?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
We... won?!
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I... I never lied!
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Why not?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
What signs?
Yes I am.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Is that bad?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Jeanne, be patient.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
I'm going to get a doctor.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
What's happened?
I haven't seen him.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Can you help? I've no money...
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
It's a little cut, nothing.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
What's your work?
Szpilman.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Spoken words?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
She wants it to come.
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Which way are the rooms?
Naw, it's okay.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
You sober?
You mean you blew it.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
The wire is ten years outa date.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Looks like he's sulking.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
My end was only one.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
You doin' anything tonight?
No.  What's wrong with the front?
You move right along, don't ya.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
So could Shaw.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
You're dreamin', kid.
You're a lucky man, all right.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
You know how they are... sex...
How are you?
That is, if it's all right with you.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
Dorothy!
You're high enough.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
Then what are you hiding?
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Is your father still in there?
Another Martini --
Macaulay.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Come on in.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Where are you going?
I know -- I know --
What's he want of you?
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Rosebreen.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
He telephoned me today.
I see.
No.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
Good morning --
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
But suppose some business comes up...
Well, let me do that for you.
Thanks, and goodbye.
Is Julia going with you?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
How are you?
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I've never heard about you.
Why do you say that?
You might have mentioned me first.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
What are you drinking?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Someone get a doctor.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Yes.
Your guess is as good as mine.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
What are you going to do?
Yes!
Yes.
You're going to drive me crazy!
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
I know I left them there.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
They shouldn't have been here.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
For climbing.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Maybe I do.
Get off him.
Give it to me!
Blow me.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Now this is war.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
SAY IT!
What!?
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
They're going to kill us!
What are you doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Must be a compartment.
Sorry.
And then shoot them.
Can't you--
Is that good, or bad?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Which way do we go!?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Epps.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I don't know.
Woods.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
What is this?
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You get it yet?
Yeah.  So?
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
If!  If there's a treasure.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
So?
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
What the hell are you doing!?
You're going to burn up in those.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
4732...?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Why are you so concerned?
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
What?
Maternity ward, huhh!
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
No...no you're wrong.
Officer Reilly, vice.
-Where?
How's the print coming?
Just do it.
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Yep.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Would you?
Good, now the other side.
What... ?
Right.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Lane oil...
Jesus...
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Vice... Jesus.
Look who's talking, old man.
Reilly, Vice. I-
Device.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
And diamonds in the front.
Eleven o'clock! 
<u>Tonsili!</u>
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
No!
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
I hope you find the figures correct.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
Yes, m'sieu.
Why should you?
Thank you!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Now, Lily--
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Yes.
I know that niche.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Do you know my first name?
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
Yes!
Oh? 
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
It's disgraceful!
Yes, I would!
And you're going to fall for them.
Any minute I want!
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
I <u>must</u> go.
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Thirty-three--
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Yes, madame?
I think you'd better go.
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Your bag?
Yes, my bag!
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
You told me to change.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
This should be amusing.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
You're distracting me. Go away.
The fall alone would kill you.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Sure. If you like.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I'm sorry.
Would you like anything?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
Sure!
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Good afternoon--
You'll excuse me. 
What did you want a gun for?
I thought you were one of my friends.
There's soft music--
Very--your mother?
When?
Sooner it you like.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Here you are, sir. 
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
How?
Back is in New York.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Hello, Denby!
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
What's the matter, Mary?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
So what?
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I wish I could.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
There you are, sir.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Nice voice.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
He said to turn loose of him.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Forget it.
Yeah, you look it.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
How you feeling, Doc?
Not exactly...
Since when is faro a business?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
What?  But I saw 'em-
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
What?
Colorado's closer
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
I didn't mean it that way.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Well hello, Sherm.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
That a fact?
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
I see.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
I'd rather die alone.
I'm sorry.
- We all want what we can't have?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Is that any way to say hello?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
No?
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Sleep well?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
... Yes???
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Of course.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Stop it!
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
The Queen invited you to dinner -
- I told you! He was there! -
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
What did your wife get her?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
Go back to sleep.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Man, act like this is your home.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Harry, you know everything.
Good afternoon, ladies.
You invited me.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Some people grow up and change their ways.
None of your business.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
I was just trying to make conversation.
How are you?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah?!
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
I could have stopped him.
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Right?  Buddy?
According to my nava-computer, the --
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Spaceship.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Don't tell me what to do!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Come on, this way!
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Hold on, Woody!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
Hey!!
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Toss 'im overboard!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Sir!  No Sir!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I want to go home.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
You're only a young thing.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
Stop it!
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
H'm?
Did you now.
Did you do this?
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
What is he planning on telling them?
What is he being charged with?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl --
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Okay, young lady, that's it.
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
That's a big word for a fisherman.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Somewhere safe.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
My work keeps me young.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
I got money.
I don't know what to say.
What?
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Like you protected Landry?
Hello.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Twenty thousand.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
What?
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Diane.
Ssshh!
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
No.
Unless you get caught.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
You take the test?
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
So?
Four Grand.
That's tough.
Well, it's up to you.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
No, I don't think so.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
The ship....
Position, Bird of Prey?
A Federation starship.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
And that is?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Jim.
Goodnight, Spock.
What do you mean?
You ordered me to kill my brother.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
We must change our course at once.
You are mad!
No special conditions?
I want to go to his place.
To warn him.
Of what?
Come on in...
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
That was uncalled-for.
Dumont!
Well, isn't it -- ?
What's that?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
How 'bout yourself?
What's goin' on?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Thank. you, Master Control.
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
What do you think?
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Okay, Dad.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Copy that.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Put a tap on her phone.
Guy's a spook!
Give me the page.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
My husband is a good man.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
What did you tell him?
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are we going to die?
God, you have great legs.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Worse than Cairo?							*
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
What letter?
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
I love to get pie after a movie.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Do you get paid a lot?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
You have a pimp?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
I think what you did...
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
I don't blame you.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys.
Clarence.
In case of what?
I'd fuck Elvis.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Say it, goddamn it!
I can see what you mean.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Where'd you go?
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
I'm really not very -
What do you want from me?
What?
You were a cop.
I got some money I can give you -
I've seen him.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Sure. No problem.
Do you believe him?
Suspect's words -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He knows.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
No way, Jos.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Sorta room-mates?
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
No, sir!
Him?  You saw that man?
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
That's him.
It's important to observe everything.
And your only goal is...???
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You wouldn't understand.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
No, 1995 is the past.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
You used to call me "James".
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Are you hurt?
We need gas.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
It was?  I didn't...know.
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
But you know what's real now?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Maybe I do.
You don't fear death?
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Can I help you, sir?
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Yep.
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
I want my car.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
Jake, what is that?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
That a fact?
You're not from around here, are you?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I didn't say it bothered me.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
John?  John where are you going?
John, please--
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Grace . . . Grace?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
I shot him.
You killed him!
He was going to--
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
I'm her husband.
Husband . . .?
A lot that means.
I have half a mind to--
Accident.
You've got to be--
Wait a second--
Like you don't know.
Talk?  About what?
You're talking like a mad man.
You meant it.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Liar.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Come on, Jake--
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
Oz.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
What happened?
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
Say, what happened to your hand?
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would I what?
I do.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
That's a bit much.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
I came for Grace.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
How old are you?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Great!
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
What?
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
Accident.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
Nice place.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You know what I want.
You'd never understand.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I can't see it.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
Why?
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
Can you make it back up?
"Arkady"
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Beck's.
Heineken?
No baby, you got it wrong.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Is that the entire message?
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I don't know. It's been a while.
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
Quick.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I won't make any noise.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
What do you do if something happens?
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Was your family traveling with you?
...I got a present for you.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Are you really going to kill them?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Like I said, I...
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Who killed him?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
What'd Ned say?
He said that, huh?
Three ways, I figured.
You're goin' back with him?
They takin' water?
Yeah, he's in there.
Did... you... get... him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
First one I ever killed.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
He hit you?
You're marking us, Bill.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
We done that stuff.
Well, suppose he does?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
Umm ...
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Don't hurt me.
Tough break.
Well, I'm sorry.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Which is shit.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
I know of him.
How old are you?
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
I did.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
I thought I would need it.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Yes.
Why is that?
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Yes.  Price...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
The TV didn't work.
Yes.  It was, actually.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
No.
What are you going to do?
Are you out of your mind...?
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
...I have to stand up for her...
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I'm swell.
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
The broad has disappeared...
...four years ago...
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
In New York?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Dr. Towler...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
As I've said we had some more...
Me, too.
He won't talk.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
Almost a year.
Like all this.
No, I'm all right.
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
I didn't mean to be that rough.
Well?
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
But you haven't lived here long.
Don't go.
I'll take care of you.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Judy --
You don't even want to touch me.
Where shall we go for dinner?
How does it work?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
What are you going to do?
Do you remember where you were?
Please drink your coffee.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Would you like some coffee?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
I don't like them.
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
Would you like a drink of water?
Yes...
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
No!
Vaguely...
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
No, don't go away!
Where's your husband?
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Here with you.
You can't.
Oh, yes!
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
What is her name?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
Why?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Three whole weeks.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Could be.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
What.
Step number two.
Johnny!
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
For what?
Here you are.
You haven't told me everything.
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Mm. Better.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Well...
Can we have it by tonight?
Jesus.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
You're an asshole.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
Why was the floor wet?
You're pathetic.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
The hell I don't.
Don't even start.
She's got no fucking pulse.
What are you talking about?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
There's more.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
What about the blood?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
That is absolutely not true.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
Adam! Calm down.
No way.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Call 911.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
Isn't it a little late?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
The hell I did!
The hell you didn't!
Your ideas never work out.
And what happens when you can't?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Easy Micheal.
Goosed!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
This is ridiculous.
Yes.
You forgot the tent?
You can't play around with these tent people.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
Time out.
Okay.
Not padded ones.
You go down there.
I'll call them from the road.
I will.
Now?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
What?
It's too late.
But...
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
He's your brother.
Go for it.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
There.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Fucking desert.
Right.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Enedina and Paco ...
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Come down here, you scamp.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
What do you mean?
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
What will the lady say?
She won't even know.
Yes.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
Me?
He was asking for it.
What's the matter with you?
So, Ramona!
Kill him.
I don't know, sir.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
It's for people!
Stop this!
Why not?
He came in through the cupboard.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
Mother?
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
What's the assignment?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
HEY!!!
It was me, what?
Help me get out of here.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
John died.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
I've been in prison, remember?
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
She's beautiful, you know?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Don't get out of the car.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
What are you saying...
For Schumann.
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
...mmm?
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What rig?
Naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  Oh, Lord -- this just got <u>Big</u>.  I see it -- <u>Big</u> -- Big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
Who would find out?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Yes.
The Hostages...?
...take a long view.
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
What are we going to do?
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
Hello...?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Is there a press conference today?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
...uh ... No, that's...
I'm sure they do.
W...what?
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
Mmm.
...what happened...?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
...but...
...one more day.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
The FAA announcement.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
You sure?
Yeah, right...
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Oh no, no...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
You really do believe in destiny?
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I don't.
...isn't it perfect!
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
Do you think you're ready?
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
I can't...and I won't.
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Hmm.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Jenkins!
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Can this be stopped?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
I know that.
I started seeing things.
What?
I didn't want to come.
Do you really think so?
Fireball?
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
What does she look like?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Toward the end.  You remember?
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
What?  What are you afraid of?
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
And then you weren't there.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Love.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
It's niiice.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Jody, no...
Mef?  What's Mef?
Are you okay?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Why?
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
If she was dangerous before--
I can't believe this is happening.
I don't know...
She's awake.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Think I may have cracked it.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
You didn't?
A flare?
Norman...
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
This is the Feur thing?
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
The accident...?
I'm sorry...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
Ow!
Oh God...
Stop...
It's alright.
She can't be here without me.
What?
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
A what...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
Who is this...?
It wes a dream...!
You - are - a - murderer.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
STOP!
Explain this to me --- violated...?
Made it...?
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
Harder...
Yessss...
Harder...
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Do you love me, Michael...?
What about your work back home...?
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Your beneficence.
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
BRIAN...
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
No - not all the time - I mean
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
I don't know
You don't know?
What did you do with her?
I don't want to talk about it -
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
I don't know...
Tell me how it happened...
What's wrong?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
So far away? In Xenia?
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
Well?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Ted! Do something!
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Most places are, Jimmy.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Very funny.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
He didn't. He had it built.
He phoned it in.
Eventually you'll let go.
You're amazing.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
I'm trembling with excitement.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Come on.
That's hard to believe.
You think you're working with chimps here?
That's part of growing up, honey.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
I do?
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
In a hurry, are we?
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
You saw the news today?
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
About a year ago.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Where's this coming from?
I want a full-scale investigation.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
This wasn't my idea.
What?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Get off my property.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
We have to stick with the plan.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
You think that's wise?
But check this...
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, let loose!
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Sam...
Yeah, right.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
What was all that back there?
Uh... how long ago was this?
This is good.
What's this?
I know!  I know!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Really?
She's perfectly safe.
You bring the best out in a man.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Nicely said, sir.
And?
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
I've even printed my own currency.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Dr. Pemberton?
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You're not going to use it, are you?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
You managed alright.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Are you a warrior?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Madmartigan, I need your help.
Watch it!
No!
How am I gonna do that?
I just wanted to test it first.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Queen Cherlindrea?
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
What have you got?
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
What was that?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
No, no doctor...
Your husband's?
I'm going this morning.
But Stoltzfus said...
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I was being foolish?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
It's me.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
That is idle talk.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
Get back in there.
Momma... are they angry with us.
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Run, Toto, run!
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Yes --
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oil can.....Oil can....
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh --
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
We might.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
How about a hippopotamus?
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
What?
...along.
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
No -- No -- No -- No!
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
No, her dog!
Quiet!
...of the West.
To Oz?
Oh, did - did you see that?
Yeah --
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What is it?
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Is there another way?
Do you know what youre doing?
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
He survived?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Who is it?
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
He was my father.
What is it?
Was this all about the oil?
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
Whats your business with Elektra King?
I thought you were the one in her business.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
Now...where were we?
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
What?
No! Bond!
What is this place?
Someone will come.
Why?  What's the problem?
Walter --
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Coward.  Giving up.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
Jon??  You mean he's --
Adrian.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
What about you?
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
Not bad for a gimp.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
Thanks.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
What do you get if you finish?
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
Yorgi asked me to.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
You don't have to do that.
Did you do your homework?
Where's he headed?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Sit down.
Why you dogging me up?
What's "Anarchy 99"?
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
Anything else I can get you?
Were you now?
Logan, do you see this ring?
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Who?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.

Reputation.  Reputation!
I thought it was wonderful.
