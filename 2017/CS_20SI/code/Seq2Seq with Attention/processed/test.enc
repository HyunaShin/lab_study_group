C'esc ma tete. This is my head
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Hi.
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
The "real you".
Wow
Is he oily or dry?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
What?
Why?
But you hate Joey
Never
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
It's a lung cancer issue
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Where ya goin?
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Hey.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
You think this'll work?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Pick you up Friday, then
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
And why would I do that?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
And I'm in control of it.
Busy
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
The Partridge Family?
A soft side? Who knew?
Yes
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Is that a request or a command?
Why not?
Answer the question, Patrick
Oh huh
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Parts of it.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
You're completely demented.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
How far from here?
No...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Chief knows.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Father Marchena!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
May I speak freely?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Do they have such thoughts?
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
I can't take you to my place.
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I let her take a shower.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
No.
You know what that is, right?
No, what is it?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Nah, why should you?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
So am I.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
You promise?
See you later.  Good luck.
Ready?
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Speak English!
I did.
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
I speak English.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
Good morning. How's it going?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
Are you coming to my party?
When are you coming home?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Yes, Daddy.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
I will if I can, Frank.
That's true
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I ain't tired yet.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Hey, what about me?
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You're gonna help us take him.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Yeah?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
Thank you.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Last night.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Must be billy's girl.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
You okay?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
I didn't have the time.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Hey, you know what I really think?
You sure you want me to?
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Hiya, kid.
You real down?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Whaddya think?
Tell me.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Shut up.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We have to save the world.
It's a miracle!!!
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Six to the left. One to the right.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Is that all?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Why not?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Where you going?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I want to sleep... forever...
At least I won lunch.
The cash man!
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
You couldn't?
What you see is what I got, mister.
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Machine.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't ask questions.
I told you, I don't know.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Something like that.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You're asking me why?
Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Uh huh, pleasure.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Okay...
I'm not positive this means anything.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
No.
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
None too discreet, is he?
Okay, I'll take it all.
No, you may not.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Alice, you think you can leave?
You alright?
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
We'll figure it out.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Kristen, what happened?
How long have you been awake?
Is there something we can do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Hey, Rick!
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Hey...wake up.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
But how...?
Where are we going?
I'm so sorry, honey...
You think that's the place she's buried?
Mark, are you okay?
I thought about that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Vomit?
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
You, too?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
We're stuck tight!
'Us?'
Is there any way out of it?
What about down?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Yes, Griff?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
That's a <u>face</u>???
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Well, I'll be - !
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Tell me.
How soon?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
You see it?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Double A. New Britain.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Yeah.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Lawford?
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
It's stupid.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Nothing.
Okay.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Huh?
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Tonight. Let's get together.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
You knew me as a kid.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
What happened?
Going somewhere, Margie?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
You're not using it today?
Can --?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Love! I'm made of love!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Wade?
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Yeah, I guess.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about her?
That it wasn't an accident.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
We don't know that.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
But they start executing hostages in
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Because it is my duty.
We've already been inspected.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
How?
We're not going to make it.
Leave my daughter alone.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Over my dead body.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
What's going on?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
I was reading too.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Did you feel that?
Shut down accelerators.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Te...!
What are you doing, Ted?
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
I think so.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Go ahead.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
No.  Poached.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
You can't go in there!
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
No.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
But if you'll just give me...
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
What's his problem?
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
We'd better get back now.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
The cockpit? What is it?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
You are Cassandra?
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
You are married?
Was.  Divorced.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
Please, I must get out here.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
But there's no more drug.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
That where Anderson worked?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Ripley...
Is she...?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
They're in the approach corridor.
What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
They cut the power.
Range twenty meters.
So what do I tell this guy?
What did you say?
I don't want you for a friend.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Gone.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Burke!  Open the door!
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.

Hardly.
And how will you make him keep it?
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Well, don't do that again!
Wolfi!
What?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
You're not going to do this?
Why not? Half the house!
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Alone.
What do you mean?
But! I'm a married woman!
Oh, yes.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
What a strange young man.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
Sire.
Yes?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
I have no idea.
It couldn't be better.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Pupils?
Yes.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
No one calls you that.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Why? What has happened?
Is he working?
Sssh!
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Animals?
No.
What for?
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
You burned the score?
With all my heart, Mozart.
But what is it they don't like?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
I do.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
What time?
It couldn't be simpler.
Also identical?
I think so.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Do you have it?
I am so ashamed.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
I do not seek forgiveness.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
All Vienna has heard that.
Do you hear me?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
What?
What difference does that make?
What anger?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Bene.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Warn him?
What shall we do?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
No, why?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
How is that?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
Shall I read to you?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
The kitchen.
It's nice to see you.
But, David.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
No.
No what?
No.
No.
Why on earth do you say that?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
What time is it?
Alex?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
You're in a hospital in London.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I assume full responsibility.
Nice looking group.
Right.
Say, David...
I heard that.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
What's the plan?
Thanks a lot.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
I'm going completely crazy.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
I wanted to see you.
What can I say, Jack?
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
I could hang myself.
No, thank you, Doctor.
Hot chocolate?
And what, Sergeant?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
How much?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Whose death?
What's the matter, Charlie?
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
What is?
Well
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No.
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Where is he now?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Well, I
But I haven't . . .
What time did this thing happen?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
He's at a board meeting.
I'm afraid so.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
It couldn't have been earlier?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
How are you fixed?
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
How'd they --
Damn!
How many of them did he kill?
You are a fine figure of a man.
How?
You're not scared, are you?
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
Both would be nice.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Daddy, don't start with this again.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
They're making him a hero now.
Can't argue that.
Doc Mimms will --
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I don't understand.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Stop it. This is just sad.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
That's what I would have done.
I think so.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
Why, yeah.
There's only four of them...
Really!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
With my money!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
How did you know?
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
What the hell is that sound?
On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Courtney? Dinner?
Nice?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end, see? So?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
Yes?
You just haven't been looking.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He's good-looking.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Listen, what about dinner?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Patrick? Is that you?
Call me please, Patrick.
What's that, a gram?
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
No. Flattering, but no.
No. I really don't.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Next Saturday?
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matine of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Who?
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Coffee?
KIMBALL.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Shoot.
Nice. Very nice.
You sure?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Marcus?
Yes.
Listen, what's your name?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
I'm just screwed.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
That was -- different.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
You're interfaced with our dish.
What?!
Milo? I'm Danny.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Oh. Yeah.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
You do?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
I snuck into #21.
Why would you do a thing like --
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Thank God.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Oh.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Please don't go.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
You seem surprised to see me.
Yes.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Yes?
Be careful.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
My mother's told me all about you.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
What?
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Let's go get him!
He's too well-protected right now.
Fancy a nibble?
I'm sorry.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
That's not mine.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
My son?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
In due time.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
Nature ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Have we met?
Promised? Who promised?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Quite a collection.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
You.
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
And I suppose you're the knight.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Is there anything that isn't?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Orders.
I'm playing to win.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
What's that you're wearing?
Trubshaw again? What now?
Still a bit chilly ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Oh, hello ...
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Anyone particular in mind?
Both, actually.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
You're better than I expected.
If you say so.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
I've decided not to run for President.
I want Debbie.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Let go of me!
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Let's go.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
It's true.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Hookers beat you up?
Is that all the coke in the place?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Are any of those right?
No, Brett, I...
Olivier's in that, right?
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
You're late again, Rick.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Wash it to the windows?
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
-- Knock it off!
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
I like what you've done with the place.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Brian, look --
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I know.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
I'll handle it.
Jennifer.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
How's it going?
Homey.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I was doing my job.
I don't know anything about it.
That's a dumb thing to say.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
The outlets.
Who the fuck is doing this?
Oh Jesus Christ...
Are you still here?
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Four months.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
And old ladies?
You don't know... nobody knows...
It knows us. This one knows us.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
Let's go niggers!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Well you did.
Please.
Delacroix.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Please, have a seat.
So that's what you been doing?
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
And I'm the feet.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
So what's up with you?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
We both lied to him.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Light?
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
I don't believe it.
It looks delicious.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
What do you mean?
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Money and nothing else?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Maybe you need to start.
Aw, c'mon.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
And so I am.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
You are going to drive to the frontier.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Yes, sir.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Then you yield to me.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Is he all right, papa?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
He loves me, as I love you.
It's... too slow.
You saw West's body.
He -- He made me do it --
Epilepsy.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
You knew Sergeant West?
Baseball?
The very same.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
What?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Think it'll work?
No.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
That's not true.
West?
Pike, please --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
He said what?
But you didn't see it, right?
Fifty minutes.
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar says you were.
Wait --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Bullshit --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
You think he did it?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Sir, yes, sir!
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Bloom like a flower?
You won't find a better place!
Bloom!
Yeah.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I know.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Jesus Christ.
She was a witch.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
You mean, while I'm here.
I thought you weren't dying.
Dad!
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
You say...
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
How did you know my father?
Were you and my father having an affair?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
I need to know who you are first please.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
John.
Just leave her alone.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
Syevodnya?
Syevodnya
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Oh Jesus.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
I got what I paid for.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
You don't have to say anything
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Are you scared?
What?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I don't want anyone to die.
Something else.
Whatever.
What does it mean?
Oh! Gave me a start.
Angela?
This gonna get you in trouble?
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
That'd be nice.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Still need a lift?
What happened?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
You gonna steal my truck?
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Well I don't...
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
What do you want?
No ma'am.
LET ME GO!
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Want another?
Could you do somethin' for me?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Yes'sir.
I skipped lunch.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
What's he saying?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
I want to yank Kobo.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
I want to go talk to him.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
Where's the wife?
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
They want your autograph.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
She's such a long way home for you.
This by this...
Why me?
It's not your job.
Could you fill me in?
And what can he do for you?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
What, Sebastian?
What generation are you?
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
You could help us.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
You got a machine on it yet?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
What about a summary then.
Yes?
Next.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Nope.
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
Yeah?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
It would be my child.
Do I make you nervous?
Hmmm?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
If she is, the machine works.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
Know what a turtle is?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Yes?
Your mom was a dancer?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Yes.
Yes.
What is it?!
How's that?
Over this?
Why are you doing that?
I haven't brushed yet.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Thank you.
A wife?
I don't want to be alone.
I didn't know that.
Could we talk about that a little later?
He has a computer?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Not that one!
What about her?
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Okay. I like that.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
You wanted to see me!
Is that what you call it?
Sing it to me.
Really?  Okay!
Hi, Eve!
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Well, do we just go on up?!
I promise. Is that all?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
What's the capitol?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Why not? He has great pants.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
The recovery is very impressive.
Why did you park way back there?
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
And thanks for always being happy!
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
You don't look thirty-five.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
The sky!!!
Sorry, Mom!
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
What about relatives?
All back East.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
You have tranquilizers?
No.  I think it's just right.
Yes!
Calvin!
Get the presents and do the lights.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Let's eat our cake.
If we still have one.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
--and we will--
What are you bitching about now?
Stop it, you two!
Oh, yes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Eve?!
What's that mean?
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
He left with Sophie.
What do you want to do with it?
Then what?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Okay.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Is Sandy part of this?
Yes? What is it?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey.
No. Come on.
Yes, I like you.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Look.
No. I should go.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
Sometimes I think I do.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Hold me, Don.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Frank gone?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
There ya go.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Am I bothering you?
What else is new? Right?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Where are they?
What happened to him?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
So, what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Why not?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
You saw a lot in one night.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Yeah.
What is it?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Dorothy Vallens?
Probably not. No. Why?
Look Jeffrey.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Stop it Mike.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Yes mother.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Where's your gun?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What happened?
We're here brother.
Hello.
What?! What are you doin'?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
We paid attention in school.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
He got beat up by a girl.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
Absolutely not.
I'm serious.
Where the fuck are you going?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Uh... two shooters!
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Pee...Per...Man.
The fat man.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Right now.
What are you serious?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Hello? You there?
You're right.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
I believe these young men are right.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Have you no fear of God?
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
That sets it off.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Holy shit.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
You were asleep.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I don't think we can do that.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
She needed it.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What time did he say to be here?
What do you think?
Dignan. Take it easy.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Do you like Inez?
I don't know.
I'll get him.
No. I'm not.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Scale the --
You mean like techniques?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Me?
Death.
Absolutely.
See you.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
What?
Why not?
Were you adopted, Bob?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Were you born in Mexico?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Wait. Did he see us?
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
No.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I paid for it.
He electrocuted someone?
I told you they were there.
Is he chasing us?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
You don't even know his name.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Not bad.
Everything OK?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Do you have your own cell?
Here we go.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
You keeping out of trouble?
He said what?
Where did he go?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
And what are we looking for?
I want to know about Treadstone.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Did he say anything to you?
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Show me again...
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
Because you're afraid!
Pamela Landy?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
You called it in?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
-- it hasn't been two years --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...
That's crazy.
What?
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
I killed him???
So when was I here?
That's a lie!
No... Jason... please...
What do you want?
Who?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
If you say so.
And why is that?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
Longshanks promised!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
You mock us with a smile?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Armed?
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
Good to see you again.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
It matters not, he is thy king!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I am the Princess of Wales.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
What is it?
Anything.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
No dances, just tell me.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
What the fuck are you doing?
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
So how's Tommy?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Of course.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
I walk differently?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Why's that?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Oh? There's proof now?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
And you are...?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Shut up, Tommy!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
How long have you been married?
Good.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Yes, Monsieur.
I see.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
-- Tonight he forgot.
Er, my check, please.
It's not for sale at any price.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Rick?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Richard, I had to see you.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Be careful.
How do you do?
What for?
Thank you. I try.
Go ahead.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I said, ask your wife.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I slept very well.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I believe you have a message for him?
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Yeah? What's his name?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
This is the end of the chase.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Yeah? Why?
What friend?
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
Our expenses?
What is your nationality?
Hello?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
No. Not me, boss.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Nobody remembers that.
Can't.  Need water.
Take it, damn it.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Get water!
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
They're on autopilot.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
You know what happened to this?
Possible.  So you did those wings?
What brings you out to the sticks?
Yeah, a long one.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
I have to.
"We're" not over-reacting.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Get back?  From where?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I thought you might have.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
If you say you are.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
The place is falling apart.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
I didn't know we had sailboats.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
For the third time.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Hello?
How about we go somewhere else?
I braided them.
You were how long on this?
Digital laser readers.
You weren't dreaming about me.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
Dr. Homer Wells.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
I mean your parents.
And that I can drive a truck!
What's she so emotional about?
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
I've never seen a lobster.
So. Not bored yet?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
I can't go nowhere.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
Migrants?
What business is you in, Homer?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
It's obviously an aborticide.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Do you like to read?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
Shit. We don't know what he is.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
When will he be home, Major?
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
She took off in the night!
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Let's just slow down for a second...
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
We'll take care of it.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Well, this is just fucking great...
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
You can't cheat an honest man.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Stake you?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I gotta go get a haircut.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
He was looking out for you.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
Miles...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
We're getting a little old for running.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Stand up.
Ten percent.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
You guys awake?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
What are you doing?
Jack Manfred.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I can imagine.
The Indian rope-trick.
What's the Blue Book price?
What?!
Eight-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
All right. As what?
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Are you drunk?
You're my conscience.
Why not?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
It's the truth.
Leave it.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Never. Why do you ask?
Yes, I know that.
I've lived there.
Oh hello.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Toss you for it.
He doesn't gamble.
I owe a lot of money.
I know that. But you can now.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Who's they?
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
Let it go.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Did you solve your problems?
Ross.
Where to?
No thanks.
What happened to Bella?
Where did you go to school?
I was at Beadles.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
How?
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
Key? Key? What is the key?
The key, goddamit, the key!
Oh, God...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Rechannel all safety relays --
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Hello, bomb.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
And you can only do it once, right?
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Veil nebula.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
You know what I think about, Talby?
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Who's Camille?
How're ya doin', Max.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
What is it?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
But I'm afraid of--
I'll make it worth your while.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Thank God.
Whoever that is.
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
Wasn't that hard.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
You believe that?
We're quoting Mom again.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Then what?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
You're crazy.
Got a pencil?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Morning, Sunshine...
How long you and me known each other?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
And because he's my friend.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They're prisoners to their genes.
Not right now.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
You get it when I get her.
Playing hooky again?
What if he's on the level?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Exactly.
Does this person have a name?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Okay, okay, okay--
I was on call. 
I want you on call here.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Thanks, miss.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Huh?
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
Right, slow...
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Damn straight we are.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Jam, listen up.
It's my Bullworker.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Well? Continue! Continue!
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
It's gone.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Look, you can have my wallet...
Two hundred bucks?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
What was his name?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
So... that's it?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You have a request?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Donnie?
Yeah?
Why?
With, like, images?
We're moving through time.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Oh, shit!
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
I know.
But you were punished.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
What?
He was a year ahead of us?
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Yep.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
Thank God for bunge cords.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Okay.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
C'mere. I love you so much.
What're you doin' here?
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yeah...
Hi.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
The bitch.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Uh, Gladys?
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My President"...
"My dear"...
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
What do you whistle?
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Then I demand an apology!
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
You told it to me.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
How'm I doing, boss?
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You swine!
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
No... it was a seven letter word.
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
One or two?
I've always thought that myself.
Yes.
That I am very little different from him.
I found it.
What is it?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
What do you mean?
This man belongs in hospital.
I want my man back.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
You never mentioned his mental state.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
You look splendid, John.
Oh yes.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
No, he's very upset about something.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Yes sir.  What's that?
A dressing bag?
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Are you the proprietor?
Pardon me?
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
It's your fantasy...
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
No... no...
How do we know this is the way?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
We're just not a very musical nation...
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
He wants to kill US!
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Oh, get it over with.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
No! Let go, Snorri!
Well, what else do we do?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
She hasn't got any.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
I know. I know.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Well! Come on!
What?
Help!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
You went berserk...
Well I'M certainly not, either.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Thanks, guys.
I did. You said, things were fine.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Okay, I guess.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
I'm sorry.
Really?
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Really? Because --
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I don't know what that means.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Probably see you at the book store.
I'm not a stalker.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Ready for another?
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
No, not at all.
Oh, yeah.
I think so.
Yeah.
When?
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
I don't want to talk about this here.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
Is that what you want?
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Hi there.
Yeah, like that.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
Okay.
I love her.
So you'll call me, right?
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
It's them.
How's the chicken?
She's so sexy.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
Clementine.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
How was it?
I hope you get your work done.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
We'll speak soon.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Oh.
Hi.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Does that help?
It's an apartment.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Yeah?
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Where are the others?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
What do you think?
I'm cold.
I'm the best.
You're the best?
Whooee!
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
It's holding... She's holding...!
How is he?
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
What's on your mind?
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
What does?
...I don't want to die...!
The crew? Could they still be alive?
What's the hold up?
Alive?
Can anybody hear me...
That's a negative, Starck.
What does it say?
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Any survivors?
You can't, your orders are specific...
I told you... She won't let you leave...
What are you talking about?
You know.
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
Now what?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
No, no, we just got her back together...
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
How much oh-two do we have?
Carbon dioxide?
Who?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
Can you see a body?
What the hell is that?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You look like an eighties rock band.
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Ben. Are you okay?
Ben --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
And they're changing into...
What?
You're hot!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Stop it.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
How's the IPO?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Reed's gonna fix me up --
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
I can't find it, mon!
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
No. I want my money back right now.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
You are a virgin!
See you later.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Leave me alone.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
What? Are you all right?
I didn't see you this morning.
Take that back.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
How've you been?
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Naw. Any good?
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
How's it going.
Should we buy a frame for that?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
What variables?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Where's Doug?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
You just ripped my card in two!
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Thanks. So do you.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
Thanks for coming to get me.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
...I've got to go home.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Anything to drink?
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Crying? Why was she crying?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Rum and ice, please.
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Naw!
This is my granddaughter...
Damn right!
Where's the medicine?
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Jesus.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Lucy is looking for you.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
We can't risk letting them in.
They'll be back.
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Who the hell would you call?
And that's how I ended up here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
We just smeared a skunk.
Yep.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
What is this?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
What's it for!?
Max?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Fine, Chief.
What?
Shit!
Hey!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Let's wait it out.
Her name is Charlie.
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Okay, but come here first.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What does Clifford say?
Get your clothes on, lady --
Dick...
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Kurt!
But, Kurt, I...
Fifteen.
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Aren't you ever going back?
Just one minute...
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
What?
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Well, the studio told me not to.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Take a walk, pal.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
That's right.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Huh?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Did you expect him to look you up?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
But they're using you!
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Then why did you bring them?
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Haven't you heard what I said?
Oh, just leave those things for now.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
You're kidding.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
Yes.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
Nice.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
People can be kinder than you think.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
What is this?
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Must've been a terrible row.
Is he not back yet?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Professor Waldman.
How is it you come to be here?
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Do you share my madness?
The killer is still out there.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Filmmaker.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
Thanks.
What is it?
I don't love Neddy.
Don't call him.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
What's this guy's problem?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Have you forgotten about your sister?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
You don't believe in suicide.
She's dead?
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Why not, against your religion?
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
Not good enough, swear to God.
What?
Do what?
I'm really sorry.
-- see this, television!
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Not even for lunch?
Whatsamatter?
Yeah?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
How do you know?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
You okay?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
I'm lookin' scared?
How?
What do you mean?
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
How are you?
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Wow...
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Shit.  Think we're had.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I'm sure it is.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I'd sure like to know who.
They're more afraid of you.
Who is it?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Sorry, didn't mean to --
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Say again?  How many micks?
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
The first female President?
Women.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Where's Audrey?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
I'll take them all.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Did Romeo have a name?
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
What's it to you?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
What sample?
You gave them the tape?
Are you looking for this?
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
So you're in?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
We've got to stop!
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
Alex you can't -just leave.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
Hi Brandon.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Brandon.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
As good as Hopkins?
Where are the miners?
I am SO SICK of being right.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
But I'm the Commander!
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
You're kidding. When for?
You should have let me hit him.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Former Commander?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Could be this.
Oh, right, sorry.
How about the pig-lizard?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Let's do it, Tommy.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Arnold!
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Is that a fact.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
A lot of years have gone by.
Well, what have you thought?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
How old are you, Captain?
Yes, I believe so.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
Partially...
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
The man is a traitor!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
Surely you knew this was coming.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
You know very well who it is that I love.
But not more than your comfort.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
That's good... who?
Yes!
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
You get the money?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
So... how many movies you been in?
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
What about her?
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
C-18.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
You say look at you?
Who the fuck are you?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm a producer.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Have we met? I don't recall.
I want you to.
You make movies, huh?
That's it? That's your movie?
Once.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
One of mine?
Martin, look at me.
What's that?
They report it to the IRS.
How'd you know I was here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
"Cotton".
Right. See how your story ends.
There a part in it for you?
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Harry... My God...
I don't know.
You don't act like it?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Harry -
'We?'
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
What money?
North Island, please repeat? Over.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Let's not be too hasty.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Maybe that is his boat.
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Get up.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Or somebody stopped them.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
What is it?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Could be a fishing boat.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
You're more practical than superstitious.
There's somebody else on this boat.
You sure it wasn't me?
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
The ah... the radio's out.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Not our mystery guest again.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
We hit land.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
How're you feeling?
Shut up.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Who?
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
What are you trying to say?
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
I...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Why?
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Why not?
Hi Enid.
What?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Much later.
There's my dad with Joanie.
What's going on now? What's he doing?
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
It's always closed...
As always.
How about this?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
It's a surprise.
No way... when?
That rules!
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
It's fine.
Do you want anything?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
That's not even --
Do you have any old Indian records?
Good luck...
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
It's not hopeless...
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What about Joe?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I-I-I...
Seymour?
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Might be exciting for you.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
How lucky we are.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
But you said they were always old.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Afraid of lions.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Janosz?
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Do you ever see him?
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Okay, that's no problem.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Or we could do that.
Is this the spot?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Well, good night, Louis.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
This is the one that looked at Dana.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Who?  Who?  Who?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
My Fault!
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
She's moving!
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Ummm -- figure eight?
Like a used car salesman.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
I'll scream.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
What is it?
I don't believe in luck.
You could say that.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
All right.  What is it?
A square?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
I'm always serious.
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
What is it?
You talked to Gozer?
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Where are you, Pete?
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Judgement Day ...
Don't you think you should at least wave?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Tomorrow?
What the hell was all that about?
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
Let him trust Quintus.
Narcissus!
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
You teach them!
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Death is a very light thing for you.
Take your hands off me animal!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Could you do it?
I think I'd better go home now please.
What?
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Why aren't you ready?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
No.
Here? In Berkeley?
Because -- I am.
I said I think it is.
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
Benjamin?
But you might.
You really will?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Oh no. He said that.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Yes, sir.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Oh -- no sir.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Yes sir?
Is anything wrong, sir?
What?
In general.
What?
You don't?
No. 
Thank you.
What?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Sit down, Benjamin.
Well I don't know.
So?
Aren't you?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Well?
No.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
And you were a student also.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
That's enough.
Don't talk about Elaine?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I see.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Now it seems to me --
How?
I'll find her.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
What?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
No -- they don't.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Say that again.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
I know.
Quite a while.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Hello.
Mr. Robinson?
I am not threatening you.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Can you see me now?
I'd like to discuss this.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
Have you a minute now?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
How?
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
How?
Oh!
Aren't you?
You were very different yesterday.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
Yes -- oh!
Nothing -- only to be here.
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
And -- and --
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
Yes -- I do understand.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
No?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Why later?
Not at all, sir. 
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
What?
How's the beautiful lady?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
You're tired. I can see that.
What, Doctor?
Stay where you are.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
I understand you perfectly.
No -- now.
Insolent young cub!
Come here. 
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
What?
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
I can't dance tonight --
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
We will wait.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No. No word.
I know -- I know.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
What you need is some relaxation.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I want to keep my teeth.
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
You're calling the shots.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
You know it, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
Roy Dillon.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Well, uh... No.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
What happened to your hand?
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
You want a drink?
I know what's bugging you, of course.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
I don't?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Where's the five?
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
Is that right?
And when he got serious?
What happened to Cole?
Atascadero.
Think about it. Okay?
I don't think I need it.
Roy Dillon?
Gun?
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
I think someone broke into my house.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Looks great.  It does.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
I can't believe this is happening.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Shane's going as a condom.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Why?  You interested?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Mommy, I'm scared.
Halloween.
Come on!
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
You've created a monster.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
What do you know about Michael?
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
I dunno, boy.
It's a bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
I suppose.
At least we found the diamonds.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
What'll you do for transportation?
Go home.
You know what gets me?
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
And how were things?
How do you know that?
You told me.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
You never played a violin.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I just want one true adventure before I die.
What?
We got to get another pilot.
For Africa.
You invited me.
What went wrong?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
As a matter of fact--
Hello.
Where's Mom?
They were in the same creative writing class.
What's good about that?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
England?
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
Where did you get the poison?
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Dad--
Can I help you, sir?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
What do you do for a living?
How do you do?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
That's what you're supposed to say.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Fish can't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
What are you going to do?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
A dozen?
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Rifle?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Like what?
He's a child!
You're begging him to kill you?
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
No.
I'm going to call the police.
Help your mother find the bullet.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
I thought she was a widow.
What brought you back?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
King Arthur.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
My violin is avenged!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Don't shoot.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
For what?
How horrible.
Yes.
What's this?
Stay home tonight!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A what kind of doctor?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Don't know.
Mom?
What?
What does he say to do?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Don't worry about it.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
Yes?
Coming.
Is he all right?
How nice.
Did you talk to Paul?
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Phooey.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
No, just not the type.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
What are you doing?
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
Wait?
Man, how many girls do you need?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
You making a feature?
Nah.
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
You don't drink?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
A friend.
Tijuana.
You really believe all that?
Where does he live.
What makes you so sure?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
What's it called?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
But the police...
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
It's just a name.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
Is Marsha there?
How's your business, Jake?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Rucker.
Take it or leave it.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
Jake.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
Huh?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Was he with a girl?
Could I see your registration?
Lady, let me get this straight.
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
I'm a file clerk.
Eh, no.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Your hearse?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
Look.
Why not?
Thank you.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
What was that?
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
I like you, Maude.
Well, why don't you?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
That wasn't very scary.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
How about some candy floss?
Look at the stars.
- end where I began.
Yes.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
At a funeral.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
What about the draft?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Yes.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Another man's life in your sights.
How about to slit his throat?
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
It's different for us.
We've always been here.
It's a beautiful dress...
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I've got to finish it.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Reliquary --
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
She's dead.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Not from you.
Are you sure about this?
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
I know.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
The box... you opened it. We came.
It's just a puzzle box.
No time for argument.
We want the man who did this --
You remember.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
This isn't happening.
Well?
I don't want to see the dress.
What about Larry --
I'm very happy.
This is what began it.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
You're still afraid.
So you were cheated.
You can't love him.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Kirsty.
This afternoon.
I saw everything.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
It smells damp.
Not exactly modern.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
It's probably going to need stitches.
I'm going to throw up.
I'm here.
Is this upsetting you?
-- I'll go see.
Oh baby.
What?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Is this your place ?
Do you care ?
No personal details?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Who brought me in here?
What a pretty tune.
You wouldn't believe me.
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
Call me tomorrow.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
I have to talk to you.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I want to see.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
I see.
What?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Nice, Barry.
Suck my ass.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
Right.  Why?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I always hated this song.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Mmnn.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
What about Ian?
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
What's the difference?
To make you feel better.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
More confident, maybe.
Where?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Enough, Liz.
Don't you like that?
Hi, Marie.
You haven't even seen it!
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Yeah.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Claymore.
It's my birthday.
Who?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
You make it all sound so simple.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
It's beautiful.
I'm not even sure why.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
You kill with your left hand?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
A murder.
Four?
All fashionably without heads.
What were you doing in Felton?
Who is it?
Why?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
What are you doing man?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Pheasant.
It is less.
This can't be.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Something pretty.
Far away.
What is your position?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Must he go?
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Kahn?
I knew his great-grandfather.
You're wrong.
You've been here from the start.
And if I refuse?
Yes.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
It doesn't.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
You're a kind man to be sure.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
When may I expect the cleaners?
What's the idea of locking this?
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
I'll keep you in mind.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Hello, Hildy!
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Say, could I meet him?
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
How much do you want on it?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Thanks.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Sure.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Walter, you can't do that!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Who locked the door?
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Where is he?
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Who is this man?
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
Any news?
Did you get that, Hildy?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
Have you got my dough?
Isn't that her picture?
Don't forget about production for use.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
The what?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
They wouldn't take it.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Why?
Give him the you-know-what.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
Only till they get you into the local school.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Bugger off.
It's easy. I've done it.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
It looks....foreign.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Up to six weeks, I think.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
We did the decent thing.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I wish it could all have been different.
Father, that's enough now
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Cone.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
The Duke?
But suppose for a second you did.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
What's he so excited about?
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Hey, he moved.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Come on, get with the facts.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Fuck, it's freezing.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
So.
So what?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
When?
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Keys.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Where is he?
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Tell it to my daughter.
Yes, sir.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
I guess not.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Over.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Gabrielle.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Like what?
What?
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
We still have you and I.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
Please let me go with you.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Ouch. Yeah?
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
And I think I'm going to.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
Oh, Rosie.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
You really enjoy my company?
I like you, too, Nathan.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Of course.
That's very funny.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
So, how's it going today?
Good. Making progress.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Ooka.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Okay?
I lost twenty bucks.
What is?
You being cute?
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
What's that supposed to mean?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Well, we won't.
'Bout even.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Give me a drink, will ya?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
With what?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Yeah, that's what I think.
When?
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Yeah. You must come again.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
You quittin' too?
You're a pretty good player.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
Eggs. How do you like them?
Is that what makes a winner?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
What is it, Eddie?
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Leave now.
Why should I?
Where's Bert?
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
...you shoot a great game of pool.
Why don't you start with me?
Have you looked inside?
Shhh... don't talk.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
I surrender --
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
What's wrong, Ellen?
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Yes.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
They'll get us.
Don't go in.
George, where have you been?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.
Oh?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
It's really nice of you to help us.
What?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
There's good news and bad news.
Can you believe this?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
Not listed, huh?
College nickname.
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
I'm making a mess.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Nice meeting you.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Yes, I am.
You're late.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I didn't even see them fire!
But I gave you some this morning.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
What the hell's going on?
Call them back.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Are you sure?
Don't wander off.
You said go between them!
Out!
Through the library?
Found it.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
My lucky charm.
The floor's on fire! See?!
What?
What?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Penitent. Penitent...
Get that camel out of the way!
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I'll take the camels.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
What?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
There are no stories anymore.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Indy?
What does it mean, Indy?
Two are still missing.
What'd he say?
THE WHAT?!
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Don't catch cold.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
So now they believe me.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
What for?
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
Where are you,...Al?
Try me.
Yes?
I just got here.
Somebody's been here.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Why he's argumentative?
Behind us?
Now what?
Too late...They want you.
Just walk down the hall?
Who did?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Just scratched my arm, why?
What do we do?
We get on a plane.
Use my credit cards.
The beach.
What is it?
Do you notice anything.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Yeah. I did it.
Now, where would I be?
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Follow that busboy.
They're all in it.
She's the toughest to read.
I don't know!
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
I can't...
Not sure at all.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
Dieter!
This may hurt.
Be quiet.
Keep thinking.
I have been... I think you're right.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
You just got a Mickey.
It'll remind me of you.
What kind of a deal?
It's a long story.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
What Job?
We met on the beach.
That crazy guy?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
Remember what?
Right.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
How do I look?
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Ahhh...nothing.
You mean from it.
You again.
I waited for you.
It's not apparent.
You talk to yourself.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
You did.
Who do you work for?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Why did you stay with me?
Wanted to get to know you.
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
He didn't.
One chip?
You don't believe me.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Why'd you ask him.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
You can say that again. What do we do?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
I knew it. I told him.
Why are you on to him?
It will.
Hi, honey.
How long?
Push it.
Are you all right?
Alright, alright.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
What the hell are you doing?
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Is there any more rice...?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Soy sauce...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What?!
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
So, is everything okay?
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Alright. What did you think?
Did I get you up?
Yeah... Thank you.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Seven dwarfs?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Excuse me. Yeah...
You try and have a good time.
Did he hear you?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
What are you talking about?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
Right.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Object to the form of the question!
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Chapter and verse.
Is that a threat?
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
Who's the pigeon?
You're in a rush.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
I don't need it.
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
My God.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
You like kids.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
You don't believe in it.
You just haven't met the right person.
He wants a reconciliation.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
He'll regret this.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
To him? He's a sick freak.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She didn't love you?
We're damaged goods.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
No.
Miles.
I don't believe you have "things."
I want to nail you ass.
STUFF.  Got a light?
You can't prove anything.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Marylin!
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Hello, Rex.
Marylin.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
You used his credit card.
Wow.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Mm.
I don't know. I can assume...
What the hell is wrong with you?
Berry spoons.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
What's this about not eating?
South America!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
What've you got against King Westley?
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Whadda you want!
I beg your pardon!
Are you talking to me?
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Of course I do. What do you mean
Do you mind putting out the light?
I can't go out like this.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
KingKing Westley was in it.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Not as long as I'm alive.
What do you meanstarvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
What's got into you?
But what!
You might give me a little credit.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Come onget in.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
What'd you give him for the car?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Me?
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
Why, he'll be back.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
SorryI didn't mean to
What's 'at?
Yeah? Where?
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
If it's on the level.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Mebbe.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
What's the idea?
That's right.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Whyno
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Bill.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
Dave?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
That's our case!
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
I'm scared.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
I'm not sure I understand.
No.
Who?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
I know David - a strange character.
What are you driving at, boss?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
His name?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
The assassination, Jack?
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
That sounds fun.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
I understand.
I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Who?
Let me finish. Can I finish?
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
I'm not a loser.
Take your time.
But now you're telling us now you do.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
You gain weight?
You're not tired of it?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Somebody loan it to you?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
You talk them into it?
He tries to act cool.
You're rationalizing.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
What's he doing?
That's Ordell's.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
You ever see him sell guns?
How can you help us?
And splittin' with her?
Uh-huh.
You didn't count it?
Ever been tempted?
Uh-huh.
There was a guy with Melanie?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah?
I got a problem...
You told them that?
Who?
Yeah, I think a woman.
But you don't?
Can you cover that?
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Want a hit?
Bank robbery.
Want a Metrix?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
You're fourteen years old here?
So where did you go?
Did you ever go I one?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
Uh-huh?
And your point is?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Thanks, Baby.
Are you serious?
Guess where I am?
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
What's your relationship?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
You know how she is.
You shot her twice?
So you're sure she's dead.
Where did you shoot her?
You said five hundred and fifty!
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
What?
Yeah.
Beaumont Livingston.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Hey, Max.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
Well, give it to me then.
In a way, yes.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
Yes.
We're back.
He ain't here right now.
Where do you want to go?
Dream on!
I see.
Are you all right?
Oh, terrific.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
Don't go.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
But the paper ...
She talk about the boys?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Ah!
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
No.  I see them.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
I didn't want to wake you.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Your kid dropped it off.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
I don't let anybody call me that.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
When was the last time I said a word?
Where are we?
What does it say?
It's gone to the top.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Lie down!
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
What's he talking about?
How?
Are you out of your mind?
Me neither.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
I can waitress. I'm good.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Oh God!
Goddamn you!
WHO ARE YOU?
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm sorry.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Count 'em on one hand.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
That black car?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Died?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
I don't have all day, kid.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
What are you doing?!!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
It bought us some time.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
What the hell are you doing?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
I couldn't save them.
See? We're not so bad.
You?
Now what?
Yuck.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
This is what it means right here.
I'm gonna spew.
Jesus!
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Did you bring a check?
The wire's showing!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Michael! Come inside!
He lost it on the way up.
Maybe we can save August...
I was acting in the town's best interests...
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
What the hell?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
You from around here?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Is that a boat?
I've got all these signs here...
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Coming right to us!
Follow him!
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
But you copy my work every week.
Okay, cool.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
We're getting a stretch limo.
Huh?
You know it's okay.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Viscera?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Commercials.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Why? What the big deal?
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
No.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Can I take your coats?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Yeah, she does.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
You're not listening to me.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
What do you make with that?
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
...I said, I like your hair.
What?
Hold still.
What's Early been in jail for?
...That's not true.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Turkey mostly.
This the book your writing?
Yeah.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
If you say so.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
All set?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Carrie, watch for Early.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
...never?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Yep.
Yeah.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I don't understand why you do that.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
What are you talking about?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Casper, where is he?
Casper! Was up kid?
Where you at?
Right here.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
What?
Sup then? Sup?
Hey.
Yeah. Come on.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Because your a virgin?
Dance!
What?
Miss, would I be prying?
The pain. The fucking pain!
I hate sucking dick!
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah.
It's like...
Yeah.
Oh shit.
Yeah.
You think so?
What?!
Hi mom.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
What are you guys doing?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you mean, no?
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
Are you crazy?
What do you want?
No.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
You got it on the board.
I'm positive.
Yes you are.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Why does he call Sanderson?
And -- what path is that?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Hello.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
I've figured out the message.
Yes?
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Why did he what?
Well?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
Where were you last night?
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
In a way.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I'm not playing a game now.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
What do you want on it?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Hi.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
I'm sure you are.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I don't have to go through with it either.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Will your power outward.
I don't know how.
Take the western passage.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
I have no extraordinary powers.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
The Beast will kill her.
I ache with it.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot betray my bride.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
What business?
You will follow me.
I'm not hungry.
These we'll pay for.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Go. I command you.
Quell?
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No.
No.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Put me down, you lout!
Food for crows.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A fine match.
Yes. We lost five.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
Yes.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
Each to his fate, lad.
I was beautiful then.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
You will come with me.
What's that man's name?
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Well, I don't need them...
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
Come on, get down!
No.
...I'm going to kiss you.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
...Don't you drink?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Mathilda, listen!
...I got lost, Mister.
Don't fear.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Yes... Twice.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Where?
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
I have to finish first.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
I've seen it before.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
What did they ask?
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Most certainly.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Red flag, man.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
That's me.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Yes.
I'm walking there Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Why know?
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Don't do this.
I don't have kids.
How are you feeling?
What do you mean?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
No.
No.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
I sometimes fade out.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Thank you. What time is it?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
How long have I been here?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera...
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Thank you, Sera.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
I've been all right.
I can't tell you.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Come again?
Sit down.
You're not going up there.
What?
Yes?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
I'm a bitch.
Yes, you are.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Power yoga?
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
She's not!
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Hey --
Someone missed you.
You should. Do you have a resume?
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
No, silly. I go here.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Where?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Hovering?
Elle?
Let's all go! Road trip!
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
God protect me.
Not from me, surely...
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
I didn't know... I --
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
You be our guest, Jack.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Don't you know?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Blackheart?
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Certainly understandable.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Easily spoken...
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
He'll not escape me.
Go on... go on...
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
You see!  You see!
Well done, lad.
Unicorn?
I'll go search for it.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Are you honest?
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
He did run?
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
I have no wife.
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
I can't see a thing.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Not very precise directions.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
And charmed, of course.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
What do we do now?
What's she doing?
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Sorry, Jack.
Lost?
Do you guys feel like painting?
What color?
Why?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
I can use your mom's.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
I'm good, thanks.
I've been here twenty years.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Sam?
I didn't recognize you!
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
George, this is the third time.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
Why would you be there?
You don't have a choice.
No.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'm leaving.
I don't know.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You're too fucking late.
Sit down for a second.
I gave up on you.
Are you talking?
I loved him too much.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I need you to do me a favor.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
She needs to be alone, I think.
Where is he?
I need to talk to you.
Why call me?
Money?
The garage.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
One of you would end up dead.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
George --
I used to live here.
What have you been before today?
It's not breakfast yet.
I dreamed about your house last night.
With your hands or your tongue?
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
Let's not do this, okay?
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Nothing.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
Do you know anything about building a house?
I don't know what I'm doing.
You're sure about this?
Nagger?
No, nigger.
Nigger.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Yes, boss.
Sure, boss.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
You went to Monroe?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
This fork is filthy.
No, man. I want you to have it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Does that mean I'm in?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Say what?
The hell you talking about? What train?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Him?
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
It's a pardon from the governor.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Why the hell not?
Yeah? You and what army?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
He's from New York City. That one, too.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Where am I at, man?
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
They gave me life, mama.
Lemonade?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
ADRIAN!
Little Nicky.
Now will you get in the flask?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
Urr... uggg... errr...
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Makin' friends already.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
I didn't murder anybody
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
This is baloney!
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
I got no ears! I can't hear!
How bad?
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
I know, your wickedness.
Boogerland!
Hey...
What's with that guy?
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Really?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
What are you doing?
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
..."The Devil?"...
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I am.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Just the face.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Had enough?
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
And now?
I'm afraid to tell you.
Why is it wrong to run?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
You know.
Are you taking me to them?
I'm afraid.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Beloved husband...
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
No.
What people?
We'll have to bury him.
What's that?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
Where are they?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Not yet.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
I like to remember things my own way.
Can I call you?
Hello.
Pete?
So what do we do?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
We killed him.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Never saw him before in my life.
You talk to him?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
What's the matter?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
At your house.
What are you going to do?
I like to laugh, Fred.
It must be from a real estate agent.
When you didn't come to the club.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
I can see that.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
What?
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Why haven't you called me?
Last time I saw you.
I don't want to talk about it...
Sheila...
Sheila... Stop...
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Yes.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Yes.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Well, that's that, I guess.
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
So there are others?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Centuries.
Very often.
The only one.
Yes, charming.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Suppose she should leave it?
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Yes.
Splendid!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
Father Perrault is dead.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
Sondra Bizet.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
What is it?
What do you mean if we should get out?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Thank you.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
What is it?
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
You shot an eight year old girl.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Well this didn't.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
Kay, I'm sorry...
I wasn't scared...
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Sir--
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
What?
what's this?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
What if he's telling the truth?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
They respond to fear, right?
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
What if I don't?
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Which way?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Actually, I don't know...
Yeah?  What's up?
Can you see the balloon man?
Oh, God...
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
And replace them with new ones.
That's not much.
We know each other?
From where?  D.C.?
They were performance pieces.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Kill type?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
I understand.  What's the other thing?
We won't let them.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Yeah?  So?
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
You gonna tell on me?
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
So?
Rufus, play it back...
I scored a goal!
You gotta have faith, Dad.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Congratulations, sir.
Lamar, I found something.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
How many?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
What about your meeting?
We could have lunch together.
This your work?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
You're Bobby, right?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Manhattan.
I don't get it. What do you do?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Uncle Bobby?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Who's watching the baby?
You talk to Max today?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
I'll support you.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
He must have that shit troughed.
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Pshhh...
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Then what are you saying?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yeah.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
You want --
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
What's the plan?
Where's the drop?
I can wait around if you want.
'Trustafarians?'
Understand me?
Can you check?
What about boxing?
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I got no idea.
I think we might.
Sorry coach.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Is that the woman from..?
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Who you calling?
Forty-six.
Great. On my fucking room.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Oh really. Why's that?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
Nothing.
How'd they know who you were?
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Like I said, I don't know.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
We're getting whacked.
The what?
We don't need guns.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
You want your surprise?
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
How much is what?
The videos.
Don't drag my ass into this --
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Can I borrow a piece of --
Yes. You're going to New York.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
Yes, sir.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
I am.
What they call you?
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
When?
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
Let Billie finish.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
Don't con me. Don't try...
What for?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I don't know how.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
What?
Just an idle question.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
Because you're in trouble.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Yes, sir, I did.
"His greatest greatness."
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
The sentences to run concurrently.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
How many you turning out?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Head nigger in charge?
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
[Who's the boss?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[Who's he?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Don't lie to me!]
Is it loaded?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
So how's business?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Why not?
And don't start crying.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Where?
Why do you ask?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
No.
Still not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
No.
It makes it all seem so serious.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
For a year?
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
You do?
She likes him.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
You want me to ride down with you?
It must be one o'clock.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Your son Marty?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
You come up here often?
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Please...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
I'd like that very much.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
No, I'm not kidding.
I'm just here with another girl.
I'll see you around.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
Hiya, Ralph...
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Waddaya talking about?!!
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
You boys'll have to go to work early.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
What the hell's going on here?
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
We could steal one of the choppers.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
I was just asking...
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Even if I weren't.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
Why would he do that?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
The one and only.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
How much time do I have?
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
Damn.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Against anything. Just protest.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Ted Sheldon.
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.
Oh!
Oh.
The Websters.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
You made it up.
Who, for instance?
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Has he been here?
No.
I ain't seen him for a week.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
No!
How could he be a fake? 
Four bits.
Join the John Doe Club.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
No.
What's your name?
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Not that we know of.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Who's controlling your mind?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Yep.
Is that all?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Yeah.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
So what do I say to this guy?
I'm not good at lying.
You know the ten commandments?
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
The 6 horse is last.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
And what about the ones you don't save?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
That's a chance I gotta take.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
What do you think?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
You like this place?
It's very nice.
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Prude.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Stay up there, Girl...
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
I'll provide you with transportation.
Roper...
Who's running it!
True.
You were right.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
It's not real.
Unfinished business.
How long 'till we can eject?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
What is it?
That's right.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Who did he digitize?
-- The inside?
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
This.  No point to it.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Program name?
We've got him locked!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Release the power with the power.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
I see... a fox
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
Two thirty three a.m.
... Not bad.
I'm in!
Here you go!  No pushing!
There goes the neighborhood.
That was a CHEAP shot!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
You've got the public upset, Al.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
And now you have everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
What do you mean?
When my money moves, I go with it.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
He was around...
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Well...
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
Inside, they were talking of you.
You here with Bobby?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
I was calling yesterday.
Same here.
Why? You're the innocent one.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Meyer.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll handle the Boss.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
I'm glad ya come.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
What the fuck does that mean?
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
What a cozy little scene.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Got a doctor on duty.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
What's the "bad" part?
How was it? I don't recall.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
When'd you get in?
The ring...
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
... What are they all doing there?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
What happened?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
... Oh ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Thanks very much, sonny--
What's this, Diz?
Huh?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
You play--left field.
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Drunks are funny--
Tonight?
I'll cherish ya.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
We're gonna get married.
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Okay--I mean--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
No--not offhand--
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Taylor, my dear.
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
Oh--oh.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
*You won't?*
What!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Me! Jim--how--?
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Will the Senator yield?
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Mr. President--
I have no defense against forged papers and--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Hello, Jefferson.
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Is--is something the matter?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Committee.
Why?
Yes, I see that.
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
I did--and--and I got right up.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
It *is* not!
No!
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
What you *have* to do is fight!
But--I've done everything I--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Yay!
Then you *did* say it.
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yeah?  And what else?
He's lost complete faith in me--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Jim, you don't have to--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
How nice.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President...
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Thank you very much.
I haven't.
Yes!
And you saw them happen?
What's that got to do with it?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
What did they say?
It's wonderful.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
He did?
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
People have been crucified before.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes sir.
Me sir?
I wanna see that guy!
Better wire him right away, John.
Come on, John. What happened?
Nuisance value?
It's a lie!
You can't?
Yeah?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
What for?
Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Uh-huh.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
Uh-huh.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Ja.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Yes?
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Don't pay any attention to her.
South Dakota north.
Is she home?
Yeah. What?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
But she's on the telephone
Shall I call the police, sir?
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
Uh-huh. What are they?
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
Take your time.
What's that?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
What brought this on?
I'm sorry, your honor.
Oh?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
I think it's like... inquisitive.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
...And?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Is this the treatment?
Sorry... I'm done.
Sore throat?
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I don't follow you.
Transference.
Hello?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Do you think that's what he wants?
No again?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Just you.
Damn! What is your name?
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
Where's your new friend?
What does he want the book for?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
The key!? She has the lost key!?
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
Two hundred pounds.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
No, I mean --
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
What do you suppose killed him?
Where's my gun?
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Hey... you okay?
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
How's your dad?
Snap out of it!
He'll never make it.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
They always call the great ones nuts.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Just a waitress.
Curiosity.
Or talk?
Hi.
I admire you.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
What have they got that we ain't got?
My heart died a long time ago.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
GET MAD!
Ow.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
What forces do you have at your disposal?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Where are they?
Yes, sire?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Read it back.
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir.
When you eat him, may I have some?
The first reports came in at about ten.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
No, sir.
Thank you.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
What's your name?
Lisette La Croix.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Open the door.  It's me.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
That is correct.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Come in.
Come in.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Anything you need.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Where you going?
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
I can't taste nothing.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
What's the matter?
Blow.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You go first.
Naw, you go first.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
You did all this for me?
I did.  Is that door locked?
It's locked.
I don't play for no team.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
You see that?
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
He's inside the house?
Why did he go in the house?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
20 minutes?
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Don't remind me.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
You were very nervous.
No.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
I killed you.
Don't you threaten me.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
I don't know.
Are you sure?
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
No. Kisses to you.
I have to do something.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Please...
What are you supposed to do?
Yeah, all right, listen...
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Everybody does?
Laughs.
Get moving.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Keep your eyes peeled.
I'm looking for them.
And what happens if I don't call you?
That's enough.
Come Back.
What gives?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
About what!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
John...
She's gone to Moundsville.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John, where's your folks?
Up river.
Nothin'!
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I don't know nothin'!
Now: Where?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
How old are you?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
About our secrets.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Didn't you have no inkling?
The first night?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
He never asked me for nothin'.
You okay?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
Uh-oh...
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Sure, but...
Who? Who did that?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Mother, for petesakes.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Nice to have a fire.
What you dream?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
You feel better now, right?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Good evening, Gaston.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
No, sir.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
We can call our ambassador.
Leon, my little boy.
Let's do that.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Comrade Kopalski...
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Yes, Comrade.
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Give me another double brandy.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
No visa.
Oh no. No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
What for... why?
Me?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
I will start with you.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
It's twelve o'clock.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
What?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
You see? Life can be so simple.
I promise... I swear.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
A funny story?
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
It's dead.
Who cried that one?
They belong to the people.
Yes, sweetheart. 
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Hello, Leon!
Those newspaper people?
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
What did he say?
Months, Swana.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Now, please, Swana.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Here, please...
May I have your bags, madame?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Yes.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
Raw carrots and beets.
The future of the common people.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I understand that, sir.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Mitchell?
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Can we get around this, Al?
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
What's Liddy got?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Fucking hell.
But what are we paying him for?
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Oh, my goodness ...
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Who we working for?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
What do you mean, Jack?
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
It was illegal, what he did.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
... give me a break, Mary.
You're shittin' me.
Ernie Davis.
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
What's in there?
Sir?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
I'll do it.  No more.
Is that the truth?
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Then I'll be there for you.
He looked old, didn't he?
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
I've missed you.
Are you okay?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
You personally?
Congratulations, Dick.
And what am I doing?
It'll be over soon.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Some say you are, Rocky.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
In Angola. Yeah.
Yes, you've circled round.
When did he die?
You're discouraged.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Oh yes.
He won't neither. He never has.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
No sir.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
How's that, Sheriff?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
I thought it was a car afire.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
I ain't got the money.
What'd you give for that thing?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Yeah.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Promise?
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Llewelyn?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Huh? What is...
What way would that be?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Just call it.
No.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Somethin' like that.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Were you in Nam?
...You didn't take the product, did you?
I don't know.
Could I have that in American?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Junior year!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
We think we know where Betty is.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Oh. How come?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
What?
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I don't think your friend likes me.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Didn't I?
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Yes.
I begged him to let me put that on!
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Did you love it?
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
No. Loma Vista.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
He has no heartbeat!
You don't sound like you're from here.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
He is real.
Are you sure I can borrow this?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Could you give us an example?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
He told us it's in the Buick.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
What the hell was that, another statement?
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Half.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Isn't that the point?
Can I have an evil twin?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
What did you say?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
You, Zack?
Yes, Sir.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Yeah, I know.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
Before that.
I didn't call you anything before that.
No, sir!
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Something tells me you've been here before.
You're sure it's okay?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
What do you mean?
No way... Would you?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
What did you tell him about the baby?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Be a friend. Leave.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
That was great.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
What the fuck is funny about this?
The fuck did you do that for?!
Remember that.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
I can't just...
Fuck.
Who is this guy?
Where did you get this clown?
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Pure idiot.
She said she did.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Yeah?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Huh?
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
That door is a safely hazard.
Watch your mouth.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
"What we want is in that room."
YOU HAVE TO!
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
You know it. Stay Black...
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
What's the pig's name?
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
No.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Are you going to meet with him?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
You know how old I am.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
And what do they know?
I don't care.  I hate him.
Please.
A long time ago...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
Long time.
How far away?
But father, they might come this way.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Because you promised.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm not tired!
I'm sure you're not.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
Yes, but--
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
But--
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
Louis, are you sure?
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
No, I really think I do.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Ceremony?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
I'm glad we got here in time.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
Miss Swann.
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
How did you get off the island?
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
We had time to get to know each other.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Tortuga?
Depends.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Are you certain this is the right way?
You've seen it?
No.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
... plastic.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Oh no?  Smell this.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
You don't want this.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Aaabout...?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
You're afraid of him.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
What's it smell like?
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
Why?
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
That was an egg?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
What in the...?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
I could have you fired right now.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
You're the Tribune man?
Yeah!
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah?
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Yes, sir.
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
A what?
My play.
Araby?
Sure.
How do you like your bath, sir?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Dawson, sir.
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
That's a canary, sir.
Yes.
Thanks, thanks.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I dyed one and washed the other.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
It'll be ready in a minute.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
No.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
I beg your pardon.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
What is it, Smythe?
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Stop calling me Mother!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
It's haunted just the same.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Mary Sue?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Oh, hello Betty.
She's crying.
I've got to go ...
It's alright. Let me see.
All night?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
Sure is pretty.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
What?
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
What happened?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
Okay--that's enough!
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
You're not allowed to lie.
Dan! Arrest them!
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
God, David. Just give it to me!
I still don't see why we're doing this.
You know him?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Those are my friends.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
Jen please ...
The pages filled in?
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
What?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Keeps going ...
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
They just grow like that?
Right. And how did she dress him?
What the hell's going on!
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
I want a word with you ...
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Bud?
Really?
What's wrong?
Yeah ...
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Somewhere in Utah.
...please, I just don't want it....
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Why?
Are you gonna do it?
This is Georgia.
Nothing.
Where are you?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I'm going to work.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Me?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I need help.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Do you want to pick me up?
Who is it?
About six months.
No, no. I did.
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....No....
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Yeah.
I don't freak out.
Yeah?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
I forgot about that.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Did you do it?
I didn't do it.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
Hello, how are you?
Yes it is.
-- and this is confidential?
I'll say whatever I want --
Yeah.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
Like a psychiatrist?
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
What is this?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Please don't do this.
Yes.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Nothing.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I know.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
Nothing.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
Yes, Abbe?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
That's enough.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
I saw the longing in your eye --
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Shut down?
He'll do no such thing.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Quite.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
Yes?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Is it awfully violent?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
...yes, I've got that bit...
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Good God, Marquise --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Uh-hub.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Why is that, Louis?
Then you explain it to me?!
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
You needn't use that language with me
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Sir? 
Sir, I-
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Telling stories.
Like a bug.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
This better be good
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
It's too late. The movie's made
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
You gonna watch?
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Get out
They've all seen a rough cut
For Christ's sake, shut up--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
This looks done.
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
What's wrong?
Whadda you care?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
With her? How?
Do you see her yet?
You want us to wait for you?
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
I like the gym smell.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Huh?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
And you're drinking with them right now.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
Who said they left then?
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Your Lisa?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Jefferies.
Where?
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Hello.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I knew it!
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
That's abnormal.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
And some man will lose his.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
What about this morning? Any developments?
Mrs. Thorwald?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
And you love life?
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
I have one now.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
Is he cleaning house?
Wasn't that close?
I'm glad they let you out.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Meaning me?
Yeah.
How'd he get in?
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
Mother--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
No!
Is he there?
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Jim!
They're looking for you!--
We know.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
There's only one key.
Isn't he schizoid?
When was that?
Plato?
That's swell.  How are you?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
'Bye, Mom.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Good Lord!
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
What's that got to do with it?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
Where what was.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Sure.  Lots of times.
You can't talk underwater!
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Gabriel, let him go --
Is this him!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
We sell children's toys --
Radio said negative five.
No --
No, c'mon --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
I'll see what I can do.
...the truck driver...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
Nick --
Get the hell off of me!
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Get your own room, Ashley.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
You... you... YOU --
What?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
No, you can't --
You what...
Yes!
Yes!
You knew the place --
What?
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Do I get a country-western name?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
What... Powwow...
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell you haven't.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Rudy, don't move --
But... I had a five...
Switch seats with me.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Yes.
You fuckin' wish.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
You ain't dying, he is.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
...What bar?
Me and Mr. White?
I'm sorry.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Like hell I am.
He don't believe in it.
Aren't you?
You do?
What's this guy's problem?
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
It's not good...
Lie back down, and try to -
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
I'm cool.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
What do you think?
I got 'em, all right?
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
For all I know, you're the rat.
So what is it?
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Is that supposed to be funny?
You takin' his side?
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
And one of 'em is sick.
Anybody hurt?
As far as -- Sonora?
Our kind of women?
What's the matter with her?
And this is Helen Carter.
Where do you keep the can opener?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Yeah.
So that was why she tried to run away.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I suppose it is.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
All my clothes --
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Why?
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I found their surrey --
Who's Lednov?
At the ranch maybe?
I've got eleven horses.
Can I have my gun back?
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
You know what she asked me?
I like it.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
And you're all alone.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Where is he?
Put on another one.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Aren't we stayin'?
And you've got me all figured out?
She was only teasin'.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Thanks.
Ouch!!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Shhh... It's okay.
He's right. I should go first.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Can you feel that?
Cindy, let me...
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Okay, I get the point.
Stop! --
Gear. You know, clothing.
Oh.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Here you go, Professor.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
That one.
What?
Yours, or the turkeys?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Father.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
It says, "Ray."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
What happened?
What a bitch!
Mrs. Sutphin?
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
It's sugarless.
It's him!
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Certainly not!
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
Let's get out of here.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
When I wanted to.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What were you talking about?
Nothing.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Who are you?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
And then?
I don't know.
And you knew he'd be here.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
Perhaps.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Why
Ann?
No. Why?
...free-lance. You know.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
This food is excellent.
You're what?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
You went out with her?
What about sex?
Like what?
Tell me your name.
Yes.
Yes.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Subtlety?
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
I'm not in love with you.
I've told you.
Yes.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Like maybe a big part?
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Yes. I just got busy.
Something wrong?
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Loud.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Goddam right.
Bastard...
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
Yes.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I hate my sister.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
What?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
He doesn't have a phone.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Fine.
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
I can't believe you did that!!
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
You couldn't do it, period.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
It looks like a tablecloth.
I was just trying to --
Do you have my work number?
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
The extrovert.
I just want to know why you're here.
Nope.
She didn't give you my address?
Not exactly.
Talking.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
John?
Right now.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
No.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Student?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
Yes?
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
You say something?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
We live in 703.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
A free thinker.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
I'm not going, Janet.
Sure thing.
But they only think they're happy.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Brad!
Farley!
Our field.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
You okay, Miles?
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Hi.
Are you a writer too?
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Just tell me.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
What?
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
When do we get to drink it?
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
You know that chick?
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
What?
So what should I wear?
Shut up. Shut your face.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Oh, boy.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Can you give me some room here?
Nope.
What is it?
I don't want to talk about it.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
We're on.
What's happening?
No.
That's thoughtful.
Huh. Let me think.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
No way. No way.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Love you, man.
I finished it.
Nice. Very nice.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Were you ever going to say anything?
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
So how're you doing?
Huh.
You golf?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Only for pee or poop.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Should we turn off the lights?
No.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
I'm getting out now.
Oh.
What's two?
Don't call me Father.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
And three weeks.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
You must have known that before you came.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
My name is Emmett.
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Where's the pinto going?
What's Turley like?
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
I'll see you around.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
You're kidding.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Why come to me?
Why him?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Why'd you go into business with him?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
That's the good stuff.
Where's the dog now?
What do you mean?
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
I'm glad we talked.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
Spare me.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Why isn't she with you?
Almost right.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Even the fall from the plane?
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
She said you were very beautiful.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
Not quite.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Hello?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
Yes, call me Simone.
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
How about the nudity?
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Body double.
Absolutely not!
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
You have to see her.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
If anyone asks about Simone --
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
No, that was me.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Let's take it down a notch.
The only real truth is in the work.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
What were they hiding from?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
No.
I don't know, Cole.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Yes.
No, we're not.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
They did?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
It's our pleasure.
Meaning?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
'Course, it's none of my business.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Nope.
Fuck you.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Sounds familiar.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Are you crazy?
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Amends...?
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Yeah?
What about Jeremiah?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Someone better tell Mac.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
What?
And that makes you look like a squid?
Sorry.
Pretty, ain't they?
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
What?
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Yeah.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Who's the lucky fella?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Flip.
Welcome home.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
How much style?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Why're you driving so fast?
Why? You have a bowling date?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Well?...
Driving?
Anything?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What's your pleasure?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Liquid gold.
I hate to say I told you so.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Then don't.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Yeah, but...
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Go breaker.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Did he give you his name?
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
Mmm-hmm.
Two of 'em?
I said I got his machine.
I could have it sent out...
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
What are you doing here?
You got clicks, anything?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Wow.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
That's the punchline, y'ready?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
They come when you sleep.
When did this happen?
You go home.
You still don't believe in God?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What does Snow think you should do?
What are you talking about?
You're the coward.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
Do you want to stay here?
I love you.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
You're lying.  I'm not human.
I can't stay here.
Yes, you are --
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Snow, get up here, now.
You want it coming back with us?
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Straight ahead.
You live in Manhattan?
Listen, that was my fault.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Yeah.
No dog.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Open the door, will you?
Let go!
I do care about you!
Yeah.
Not exactly.
... Mike.
So.
I like your coat.
Keep what handy?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
What?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
For how long?
Hey.  The neighbors.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
What shit, honey?
What're you talking about --
What about when she identifies him?!
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Who's Joey Venza?
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Let my kid go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
I know where everything is.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
What's in there?
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Now tell me you love me.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Huh?
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Well, no.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Waldos.
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
You sure about all this?
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Who is it?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
105-353.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
It is.
Jawohl.
Then droppen Sie dead!
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Shut up, Animal!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
What do they always say?
Not yet.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Says who?
Says me.
Lay off, Sefton.
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Right.
Who did?
What's the decoy?
You could use a new one yourself.
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
What guy?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
This is me in Cincinnati.
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Can you locate them?
We're within range, sir.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
These are my children...my children.
Well, may we have a look around?
No, no. Thank you.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
You could say that.
Keep her together until I get back.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Captain, are you all right?
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Aye, sir.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
You did great, Bones... Just great.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Later. Let's go...
Why?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
What about surface life signs...?
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Indisposed, sir.
May I ask why...?
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!

Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
... Yes...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Yes... But -- how...?
What about Spock?
Share this with no one.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
All true.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
Let them eat static.
No!
We'll lose them if they go in there.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
I know of your fondness for antiques.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
How far?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Aye sir --
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
That's it?
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
In my quarters, Uhura.
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Time from my mark...
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Certainly...
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... Best shot...?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
What's causing that!?
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
"Neutralized?" How?
So you were at Berkeley.
Memory problems, too.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Then --
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What do you mean now?
What's that?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
I'm all ears.
You want the details?
Steady, now. We need your help.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Gone?!
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
... What does that mean?
Where are you going?!
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
How do you know this...?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Why not?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
... Aye sir...?
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Full power, sir.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Hello? Computer...?
Transparent aluminum?
Hi.
Right on. You fly?
Father...?
They are my friends.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
Deceive us?
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
Jak'tahla?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Why not...?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
You're not going to launch anything until...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
That's your expert opinion?
I don't think they believe us.
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Sir?
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Why would we be involved with these people?
What...?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
... I believe you...
... I'm not sleeping well...
Augh?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
You think they're still up there?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Isn't it better like this...?
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
I have helm control.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
I am the Borg.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
This must be it.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Yes.
California. San Francisco.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
What do you want?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
What?
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
No... I'm from France.
Captain?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
Agreed. Options?
Just a little queasy...
Right.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Even Data?
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Uh, Jim...
No!
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
We're not finished.
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Retire.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
Would you care to go topside?
Just the size of my head -
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
Aft thrusters -
I hope you're happy.
Sulu!
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Never been this close.
What is it?
We HAVEN'T fired -
I SHOULD have been -
Channel open, Captain.
How did you - ?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
What exactly does that mean?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
Counselor.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
Not with the Romulans.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
Looking up at the stars.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
What are you doing?
All of this so you could capture me?
I won't defend my life to you.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
They will obey, Praetor.
Praetor.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
For the moment.
Sure.
Thank you.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
When can we expect containment?
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
No deal.
Gear shift.
What?
What?
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
From?
I am husband?
You want to try it?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
No.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Is that a baby?
Say it.
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Goodbye.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What are you doing?
Yes.
That was beautiful.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Oh, you're pretty...
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
Help me!!
They after you?
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
You get that, Lyman?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Can you see under the faceplate?
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
I wouldn't think so.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Faith, call me, okay?
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
We should talk alone.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Talk to me about costs, here.
Naw.  She won't call me.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Jesus.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
How did you hook up with Faith?
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
She still loves me.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Whatup Lenny?
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Right.  That explains it.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Was this him?
Testa?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Dylan here.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You're a... you're sick.
I've been looking for you.
Yes.
You have the photo from the diner?
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I think I talked to him.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
You are so fucked up.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Doesn't fit.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
I know.
You mean --
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
It's quite advanced.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Suspect Zero?
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
Zero killed them all?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
It was the mall.
Yeah.
Let's talk about Zero.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
It's over for you.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
I don't know about that.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Are you calling Her?
Yeah.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...not until you book it...
Hi.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
You have to lay it on the table.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Well, who represents you back east?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
It's not going to well?
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
I can call back...
How are you doing?
Yeah.
I thought you met someone else.
So what's the difference?
Right... or more likely the opposite.
No problem.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
I mean, I need the money.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Bud.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
It's unbelievable.
I'm such an asshole.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
You live in such a fantasy world...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
When?
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
That's not cool.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Always, baby.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Let's just leave.
You think so?
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, you did fine.
...Baby...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
...So give me the fuckin part...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
No. Doesn't that suck?
Which one?
So, two days?
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
What a surprise...
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
...shivering...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
The Court gave you justice.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Good for ten men...
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
You mean Tattaglia.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
No, I wanted other things for you.
I'll need him.
Don Tommassino.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
You tell us about America.
Mike!
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
Will you give this to him.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
And what do you want for Christmas?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Michael...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Tell me!
Until the old man tells me different.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
And all his works?
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Is he alive?
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
We?
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
It's just an undercoat. 
You know, a primer.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
I know. I write like a child.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
What does he say?
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
What evening?
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
I just don't believe that!
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Frances?
Are you okay?
What about Cortina?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
That's a terrific idea.
Look at me what?
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Tom?
What?
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
It's all true.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Randall.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
Ditto.
Ten thirty?
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
What did he say?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
And don't forget. I have the key.
Even your fiance...?
Does he stay with you here?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I have!
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Huh?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, we're all working tonight.
I don't know...
Really?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
It keeps ya busy.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Oh, Tom, please.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
No, why?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
That's fine.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Yeah.
What's your name?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I musta been stoned.
Well, I tried.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Why?
How?
You don't have to.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
Yes I am.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
Some. Here and there.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Your name Sport?
Things got ya down?
Neither do I, I guess.
I'm a field agent.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
God's speed.
You'll stand by me?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
I see you got the telegram.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
You mean,  me?
City hall?
How'd they get it inside?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Sir, that is true.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Here we are.
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
We've been closed for a while.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
Ernie.
Yes.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Here, one of mine.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Huh?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
"Ashes To Ashes?"
So, it is a blacklist.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
I can play the piano?
Is there a young Tim?
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
That's up to you.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
The little Brenner girl.
Good morning.
Morning.
Thank you.
Yep?
The little girl's name.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Young woman cut herself.
Whose side are you on?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
When do you think they'll come?
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
What?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Would you like me to go for her?
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Monday?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Doesn't what make me...?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
How can you tell?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
But how... how do you know my name?
How?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Why... 
How do you know Annie?
Yes.
Certainly, but...
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
What do you want ?
I do different things on different days.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
You look a little shaken.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
How long have they been gathering there?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Santa Rosa?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
How do you plan to do that?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I fear he may have to.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
I'm cold as ice.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Aye.
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Are you a doctor, too?
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Get out of here!
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Yes.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
I hate that picture.
Where are they?
Where are they? Last chance.
You're wrong.
Two down. Two to go.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
I think we should get some support?
Sssshhh. She's resting.
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
The scar.
You're him. Corvis.
My father.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It's not what you think.
No.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
He'll be there at 8:30.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
It was a wonderful day.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I'm sorry.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
Leave him alone.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
David.
Ouch, my hair...
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Thanks, Grandpa...
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Smells like something died.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Max!  What's wrong?
Hi...
Me, too.
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
This is kind of a cool place.
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
I was here first.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Sixteen.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Where these tracks headed?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
You catch anything he was saying?
Childs!  That a fuse?
Cut him loose?
Look, I'm just guessing...
Where's the other half?
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Now hold him.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
We're on fire!
Four!
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
He might just wait us out.
This storm do that?
He's one of them.
You hear that?
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
What else can they do?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
But you escaped.
Because you'll never die.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Yes...
What do you mean?
End...?
Vox --
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Now will you go?
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
I -- what are you?!
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
You're late.
Got here as soon as I could.
Admiration?  My my.
Where's the challenge in that?
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
In the future, we'll be better.
Oh?
I've been working.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I know that --
Is there a lot of illness?
Your husband is dead?
Good night, then.
Yes.
Yes!
I can see Kalen's point.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
No...
Yes, sir.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
In where?
Relax.
We are not birds of a feather.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
I gave you my dog tags.
How'd he die?
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Why?
How long do we have?
And if I didn't want to come?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
And how do you know that?
Who told you this?
I know you need one when it's really cold.
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
In the leg.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
You girls are in some hot water.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What did ya do?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
What?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Give me the keys.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
But you think he fools around.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Idaho?
Now what?
Before.
What?
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You awake?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
What?
How far are we from Mexico?
What?!  What d'you think?!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
I'll try to be more careful.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
So you admit it?
You sent that?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Gay? He said you were gay?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Never met him.
Huh? But why did Healy?
No You mean...?
Got cash.
Why's that?
Jesus Christ you're right.
Dom? What are you?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Out getting coffee.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
The sawbones?
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
-- He's in a cage?!
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Deco.
Urrggghh...
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well, I know you're busy...
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
She's blackmailing you, right?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
What are you doing?
Good good.
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
And you met Mary how?
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
What?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
I see where you're going.
How do you guarantee that?
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh, are you on the team?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
By the way, how's he doing?
Hi, Ted.
Now by killer, you mean...?
Well... why don't you move back?
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Please leave.
Ted...?
It.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Yes, sir.
Tomorrow...
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
Then they should speak up.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
What's that?
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
You're my hero, Carl.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
I see.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
What's this about?
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Were you in Nam?
This is a restricted area.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Who is he?
Her oil pan is shot.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
His spiritual mother...
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
What did he say?
Why should I tell you.
And...
So what?
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
I don't see the connection.
That's not solid.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Cuz I'm a skin?
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
What about the water...
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
I desecrated it?
What?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Good.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Mister Tully.
Do you want a coffee?
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
Yes, ma'am.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Harmless!
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
That's true. What are you?
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
Does it bother you?
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
And now?
And now I want you.
Why?
I'm fine.
What do you want?
I want it back.
What?
You don't believe that.
Now?
That's three.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
Saving them some paperwork.
Not anymore.
No! Not again!
Let me do the talking.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
That's not what I heard.
Tom Kazansky.
You think you can stay up with us.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
What the hell is this?
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
Time to go.
1000.
Skipper, you can't do this!
No, we...got our butts kicked.
That's because you don't have any women.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
ON THE NOSE?
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
We did it.
Figured it out yet?
Need a hint?
I think I can work it out on my own.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Three guesses.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
Why?
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
Oh, you mean the thrill!
Or....
You think I should quit?!
You may not think so, but you are.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Thank you.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
What is it?
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Any news of Quaid?
Where?
Pull them out.
Harry, what the hell is this?
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Nobody.
Let me go!
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
That a problem?
I give up.
Go on.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
This is too weird.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
I said get out!
So you dropped by to apologize?
I used to model for 'em, why?
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
You sure about this?
Wait!
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Cannon fuse.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Civil?  I'm civil.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
You sure this is where it was?
Come on.  Get away from it!
Ready?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
I noticed.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
How can you remember that?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
We have a full caseload, Rog.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
What other case?
What, the lunatic who --
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- What?
But what?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
I embroidered.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
I haven't paid you.
That's right.
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
What went down?
-- How could I help you?
This and that.
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
No.
It's okay. It was always like that.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
-- Roger --
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Albert.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Phillip?
Teresa Banks.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Anything else?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
I don't know, Sam.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Noooo...
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Laura?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
No, you should forget about last night.
Why do you do it, Laura?
The pages are gone. That's real.
Maybe.
No... No...
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
What's going on?
You know it and I know it.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
A friend from school.
No.
We're late to get to your mother.
No.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Leland, what are you doing?
I don't know.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
...he wants to testify...?
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Thank you. When Debby...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
And what did your team do...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
You live in the neighborhood?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
What is it?
Is the Plaintiff ready?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Why don't you get some rest?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Yes.
Is it over?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
You know what happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Then why don't you testify?
...I know. I went...
He's not in, Sir.
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
I have to talk to you.
I'm going to help her.
Yeah. I'm awake.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
She did?
Dr. Towler...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Yes.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
There's nobody left around here now.
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Can you handle one of these?
Nothing there now.
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
No.  I thought you had them.
We will, sir!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Can I read it?
And I...I've got other things happening.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Guess so.
What's up?
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
He was just here!
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
In my bed.
Your bed?
Dylan, where's the man?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
I want to see the body.
Captured?  How?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
No, not really.  I...
Can I get you something to drink?
Black's fine.
He would have loved this.
What?
Well, that's all part of it.
Yes sir.
How old are you, son?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
She isn't that old.
Feels different doesn't it?
What?
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
But that's not the point...
No, I didn't.
What the hell is going on?
Good.
So... What happened?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Yes, sir.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
Is that what you were trained to do?
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
It has nothing to do with him.
You do?
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Why'd you jump?
How would you know?
What?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Well, that was neighborly.
You've gotta be kidding?
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
You black?
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Why should it?
Nice of you to drop by.
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
What happened on the charges?
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Why, honey?
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
What's that honey?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
Actin' funny how?
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
What's that?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
They sure do stink.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Where?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
More'n likely.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Sailor? You know what?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
That was in Vietnam.
What?
Mama???
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
Six.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Just tell me what you want.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
In the head.
No... But...
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Emily?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
You're stoned.
Mm.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
His parents.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Crabtree.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Shut up, James.
Who do you think it is?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
So -- what do we do now?
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
...we find the jacket.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
'Fraid so.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
You're in Kinship?
Really? That's remarkable.
I'll miss my bus.
I had to. Didn't I?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Glaucoma?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
The one that left you?
It feels really... good... here.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Because of my coat?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
You coming?
What would you call them then?
When?
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Yes, Hannah?
That strikes me as odd.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
I'm sure.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Well...
You got me.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Someone stole my car.
I think I might have.
And what did you say?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I lost it all.
Oh?
Tony. Now that I'm home.
He's writing his name in water.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Walter?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Oh?
What is it, Grady?
I was thinking of you.
Where's Emily, Hank?
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
George Sanders?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Cherry.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
What party?
No thanks.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
They're starlings.
You always carry these?
Try.
Hiya, Walter.
You don't know?
I would.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
No.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
I'd say you're moving.
But you are taking it?
How come?
Banished... yeah.
No thank you.
The job's okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
That's right.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Why do you think you're here?
Do you know what "normal" is?
How do they know?
I don't know.
I said I was sorry.
What?
Who do you see?
All right.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
What's weird about that?
You're quiet at work.
What about them?
So... what's your dark secret?
So?
Molested little girls?
Look, you can go now.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
You're scared.
What's this?
I didn't sleep well.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
How you guys doing?
Okay so far.
Lord Almighty.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Well, that's that.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
What's the plan?
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Virgil?
What's the matter with you?
Do we just leave him there?
He's convulsing!
Y'all could be more specific.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Four or five days.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
That must be Basiluzzo.
Have you decided?
How wonderful!
Don't be so humble.
Find anything?
Yes, you should go.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Are you joking?
And why did you drop them?
Why are you looking at me like that?
What! Get married?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
To do what?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Do you consider that a compliment?
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
But for what reason should I come there?
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
And where do you find the models?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
No, not like this one.
Anything new develop?
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Your mother?
Why have we stopped?
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Because I'm getting fat.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
They were stained.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Who?
He's told you?
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Don't you know?
Then let's talk about something else...
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
No.
No.
I can't have them any more.
No questions.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
No.
Do you?
Yes.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I was a mistake.
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
She can't hurt you any more.
How?
She...
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Why?
What?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Who am I?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Who?
Who?
Not your fault...
I hate him.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
She took the baby in her arms?
Larry...
Larry...
???
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
I haven't a clue.
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
So, someone else could have done it.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The Catholic Church...
It's my affair too.
Then help her.
Visitors to the convent.
Nothing.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I don't think I care to know.
Don't deny it!
And what has that to do with it?
Right...
May I be present?
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
I'm concerned about her health.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Hasn't she had enough?
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
You tied the cord around its neck.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Lay them down.
They are?
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Can you fix him for me?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
I'll have a bash.
Have I said something amiss?
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
What are we waiting for?
Sorry.
Oh!
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Yes.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
What's that mean?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Is that yours?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Now get on with it.
Let's have you.
You wouldn't!
Is it? Is it really?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
That's mine.
Look after him.
But...
He's been gone a long time.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
What is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
What's the terrain down there?
Is it solid?
This is Chaz.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Why, what's wrong?
You like this shit?
It grows on you.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
It's really on there tight.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Right. 
Where did it come from?
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
What do you mean?
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
How's Broussard?
Still unconscious?
Good!  That's good!
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Now what's wrong?
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
That must have been when he got it.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Blow the ship up?
We can use the flamethrower.
This should do it.
How far?
No, it's coming.
What is it?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
Okay.
We do know that.
Yeah?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Any microorganisms?
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Two down, four to go.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
I'll get you out of there.
It's a rhino.
How many of them are there?
And?
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
Oh, man...
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Something spooking the rhinos?
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Hold it, hold it...
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
They've changed their heading again.
They knocked out the external feeds.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
Hurry it up.
Jesus.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
D-day.
Just like it.
Aren't you?
You know me better than that.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Yes, Addison.
Because I don't want to.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Let's go sit by the piano.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Then you've heard too.
We have that in common.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Right here. A minute ago.
Good luck, genius...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
I get a party, don't I?
She did...?
What?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Happy little housewife...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
I had no idea you were even here.
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
Addison-!
I must have frightened her away.
Don't mix your metaphors.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Here we go...
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Groom.
A married lady.
Just wondered what?
I don't have to. I want to.
I just asked a simple question.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
Everything.
You're quite a girl.
Lemme fix you a drink.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
No.
You probably won't believe me.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
I might.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Oh, no. I see the play.
She's got to meet you-
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
The show must go on.
May I have your coat?
There can't be very much-
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
I'll never get over it.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
How'd hear about it?
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
About what?
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
With tears?
Check.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
Eve?
That was a pity...
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
Would you, really? How sweet-
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
She was a revelation...
That's right, but I don't understand-
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Miss Caswell?  What?
Answer my question!
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Hey?
Hmm.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
You're not a kid anymore.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
When?
Did he just say what I think he said?
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
--what time is it?
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
But you know who did.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--there's nothing new in it--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
--you don't really think you're being followed?
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Who by?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
But they both worked at the White House?
What's this?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
To where?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Howard Hunt here.
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
I couldn't say.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
When so ordered.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
No, it was good.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Good morning gentleman.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Just go!
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Nice car.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Hi...
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Oz, it's okay, I know.
You called me Oz.
...I've never tried it.
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Thanks.  It was my idea.
You're so big!
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Went home to shit.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Hey, minuteman.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Dad.
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
This'll do.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Vicky, wait.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Victoria...I love you.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
What?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
They're coming!
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
God. I can't believe it.
What?
What does it say?
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Well, they are French.
Pull over! Now!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Claude...?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
Andy...
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Because Gaston was after it.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Why would he pick this one?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
What've you got?
Well?
How to read.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Hurry, Grandmama!
Where is your home, Anya?
You'll laugh.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
You never thought of the possibility?
Sad?
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
What?
I cursed then all!
I'm getting a chest cold..
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
You're a princess...
See? The Princess is under there ...
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
Rasputin!
She does.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Hey!
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Who are you?
It's okay.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Tsch.
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Two minutes, Alvy.
Stop it, Alvy!
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
All right.
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Nice car.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
No, I got time.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
I know.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Okay.
H'm?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
You don't want me to live with you?
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Really?
Oh, you have my body.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
M'hm.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
You followed me!
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Who cares? Who cares?
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Sinatra?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Oh. What?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Oh, I had the radio on.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Here's a real present.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Remember that day?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You're mad, aren't you?
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
It's a narrow view.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Hey.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Oh.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
V.P.L.?
M'hm.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
All right-so we can afford it.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
You think so? Do you really?
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
It was a wonderful set.
Oh.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
A long time.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's got great tits.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
What?
Not this time.
What?
He's allergic.
Borrow whatever you like.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Really.
What is that thing?
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Lucy overdosed.
She left a note.
You need to call your dad.
Let me heal you, baby.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
Anytime, sport.
We've only been over this how many times?
Happy anniversary, baby.
What?
Otis!  No barking!
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
You changed your mind.
I know.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Ours.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Something soft.
Sally did all this herself?
Elitism?
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Are you okay?
Medallions.
How do you do, Skye?
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Sally?
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
I'm sorry.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Is there space here?
Oh?
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Will champagne help?
It could be worse.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
I don't want to talk about it.
Panes?
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
You don't need to do that.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
And Cal's this massive adult?
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
I order you to find out where we are!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Come on, Z.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Ask me why we're so successful.
You're a real buddy.
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Sheldrake?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Sure.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
The mirror -- it's broken.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
In his apartment.
Baxter.
What's her first name?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
Cut.
Too slow?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
What for?
Where?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Fine. How's your eye?
I guess so.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Are you all right?
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
What kind of joint are you running?
Are you going to deny it?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Where is your apartment?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Put me down for Thursday again.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Now hold on, Baxter --
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
How many pills were in that bottle?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Yeah, wasn't I?
How's the patient?
What about him?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Doctor.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Come on, Fran.
Let me take that.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Remember what we talked about?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I wasn't trying.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
I have that date -- remember?
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Baxter?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
What !
Yeah. Way north.
None.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Charlie?
Looks that way.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
What is it?
Will they attack?
Which way? Right or left?
Who is he?
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
I met him.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
What do you mean, Colonel?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
What's that?
Captain Willard?
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
That's 27, sir.
How did she..?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
He's coming around fine.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
What's going on?
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You got one?
Don't bet on it.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Go easy.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Huh?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No.
So what are you doing with a dog?
How old are you?
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
What needs clearing up?
So. Anything else?
Thank you.
The stiff one eye?
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Hello?
Hey -- you let him...
Stop asking everyone.
You don't owe me that.
I'll never forget you said it.
How you doing?
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
How you doing, great one?
Terrify me?
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
What?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Melvin...
But you know where you're lucky?
Where you from?
Why?  What happened?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
You can't --
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
Okay.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Oh, yeah.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Such language in front of a lady.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Now what?
You want me to pump?
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
No.
With computers.
Had?
It looks like white's game.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Why did you leave the Agency?
You said you didn't trust it.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
No.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Why?
Because, I'll take it.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Attraction is a complication?
I'm not normal.
What?
Okay.
I thought it was interesting --
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
I prefer it like this.
For what?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Can I ask you a question?
This will take some time.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
What's that? Free!
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Tell them we're working for the University.
No, why?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Like a hand?
No, We aren't going to do it.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Yeah, pretty well.
Good morning.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
It's just talk, he's drunk.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I don't understand, it's your home?
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Ah, so what?
How?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
And take Jiri with you?
What for?
How do I know what's being said?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
A champion of lost causes huh?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Who you saving the dishes for?
It's Josh's.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
Later.
I think we should be going honey.
Come on Holly!
You bastard!
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
So go dance.
With you.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
A late night or an early morning?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Don't call him a dipshit.
Landon!
Who are you?
You.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'Is it really me?'
I know you don't want help.
Yeah.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
My relationship with God is my own.
You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
The play's going to be really good.
Yeah --
Maybe you inspire me.
And why would that scare me?
Is there a rush?
I have to get you home by one.
It's only 7:30.
Before we do this.
You're sometimes not sure?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Loved?
Where?
You planned this --
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
How're you doing?
But if you could, you would?
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
This week.
Like what, sir?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
I'm not tired.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
You're marrying again.
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
For Jefferson High. For books.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Yeah.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Here's your jacket!
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Well... yeah...
What do I say?
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
You have a name?
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
Pro, the sun's out!
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
An atomic bomb.
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
What do you call this? 
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
Hi, Marty!
Oh yeah?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Oh yeah?
I mean it.
What're you doing?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
My stomach's growling.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
I can look and see.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Look at all this junk.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
What?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Yeah.
Hi.
Really?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Then what?
We will, old fried, we will.
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Where're you goin'?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
You keep an eye on it.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
It's a spittin' image.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
You wrote his scripts for him?
...This'll sometimes help.
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
It's still a little early for me.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Ever act?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
...This must be boring you.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Well...
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
Yeah.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
It's more than I've got.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Must be.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
He teach you to do it?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
There's no smoking in this building.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
How is your -- personal life?
How about the booze?
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
What was she like in school?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
What are you doing here?
I'm De...
Are you arresting me?
I'm tired.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
How exactly did you hear?
I like you.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Don't get too cocky.
What did you pay Nilsen?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Aren't you going to thank me?
No.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
No.
It's OK.  It's OK.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
No?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Can I talk to you a minute?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
No.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
You workin' on another book?
Yes I am.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Nilsen?
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
Was she ever suspect?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I'm not afraid of her.
Why the hell not?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
You knew her, didn't you?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
On what basis?
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
How old was she when this happened?
No. Should I have?
Of what?
Saddle River, New York!
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
Ouch..
What's wrong?
What's with the wigs?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
Decipher?
You're not?
Not what?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Wanna go get some breakfast?
It's Monday morning.
I'm your family.
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Would you check out my studio some time?
You like your dad's paintings?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
'Phillips head,' right?
I will relay the message.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
You're not the Mayor.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
I'm listed.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
Had one.  Didn't work.
Nope, I told her everything.
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Your blood, Max.
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Working late?  I'm touched.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
What is it?
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
What are you talking about?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Umm-hmmmm.
Can he save her?
What are you talking about?
We gotta get those locks changed.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
What did you say?
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
...A bat.
All the answers are numbers.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
And another name for Mystery?
Just checking, young sir.
He's home. I sent the signal.
What's wrong?
We all wear masks.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
So glad you could come.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Would you? I'm not so sure.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
That kid is amazing.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Find anything interesting?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Excuse me.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Who is it?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
How high up would you say that is?
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
I loathe bats.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
No.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
All street mimes should be executed.
Keep her on the line!
I suggest a nice big bomb.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
What are you, scared of heights?
I understand.
How'd you know it was me?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Not what?
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
You okay?
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Hi.....  Roses.
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Let's get a coffee.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
No!
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Of course.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Of course he is.
What?
Ow! These chips suck.
Me first!
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Butt-dumpling...
Butt-snatch...
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Does that say Xanax?
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Cool, huh huh huh.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Oh no.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
You'd better sit down, hon.
That's how long you were gone.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Won't?  Or can't?
<u>You</u> left me.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
We were trying to scare your mother.
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
Tell the truth.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Three syllables.
No, dummy.  Two.
So... You're ready for me now?
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Why not?
Where is your mother?
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
I understand. I've seen it done before.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
... And please call me Robert.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Your family doctor?
Would you care for a drink?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Hello, Eve.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Yes. I am very hungry.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Certainly, Ben.
I can't write.
I can't read.
Yes. Of men and women.
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
Please, sir.
Does it have a television?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
I see...
Compensated...?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... Nothing.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
No headaches?
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
And look who you brought with!
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Yes? What have you found?
No, sir.
So...? Where the hell is it?
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
It's that serious, huh?
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Oh yeah, he's good.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Yeah. You want a beer?
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I have to go back.
What are you doing?
You've always loved the animals.
You were him last night, weren't you?
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
The monkey.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
Holy shit, yes!
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Yes, well...
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
No, really.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
That's the usual?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
I've fallen in love.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
A scary dream?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
Yes, my dear?
Think, Jew florist?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Anybody else?
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
We have to meet.
Yeah, I saw them
Mr. Malkovich?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Darling!
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Folks came.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
WILL YOU STAY?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Yes sir
What you want?
Yes ma'am..
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Won't you be late for work?
Mama let me help you.
The church!
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Till she showed herself.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
Just me.
You remember your price, Stamp?
You don't know what I think.
She was only-
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
I know my rights.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Yeah, it sucks.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Who has your undies, Walter?
Yes, uh, very impressive.
I'm not really, uh.
Lebowski on the right?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Yeah man.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
I was talking about my rug.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Jeffrey.
Oh?
What happened to your house?
So who--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
What the fuck are you--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
What the fuck?
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
Walter--
"Our" car, Walter?
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
That wasn't her toe.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
The nail polish, Walter.
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
They're nihilists.
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Dude?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Yeah?
Huh?
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well?  Aren't you?
You come all the way down here to roust--
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Two years.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Where the hell have you been?
Put it back in park, Blade.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
And why is that?
So you're going to do this?
Nomak?
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
His name is Jared Nomak.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Any casualties?
Scud.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Going on twenty years now.
Pretty.
Stupidity.
Going somewhere?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
-- he's a vampire.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
It worked, didn't it?
But he's a policeman --
There is no cure.
Graffiti --
Some kind of archive --
It's dark in here.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
You don't look so good.
How long have we been driving?
No --
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I don't believe that.
What?
How do you like that? Right on time.
Who are you people?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--I'm not staying here!
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
What?
--<u>myth</u>--
You sure?
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Baby names?
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
--you should get back into bed.
I can't.
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
I don't think it was them.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
--go!
The witch?
I don't believe this.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
--Cotter: shut up.
English.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
How's she going to know where to--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
Asleep--
Running a junk yard.
What--
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
Just hold on!
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Women miscarry all the--
What'd you see?
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Still working on it.
Sure. I'm sorry.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Anna--
--it's urgent!
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
What?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
...Where is everything?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
How long did you watch her?
Yeah. Is it...
Ya catch any fish?
Has Ray come in yet?
You said the usual--
Red Label.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
What day is it today, Angie?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Who knows you have these?
Frank?
Yes, but.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Never before this.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Yes, I like you.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
No. What is happening?
Oh shit.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
It used to make me laugh .but.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Do you like my body?
I want you to hurt me.
Frank would open you.
Do you love me?
Dorothy. no!
You called me Jeffrey.
I want you to stay with me.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Yeah, how did you know?
What else is new?. right?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
O.K.
Are you sure?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
You better not, Jeffrey.
You like mysteries that much?
What is it?
Where to?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Yeah, I know.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
On the plane.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Excuse me?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Why are you speaking?
What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.
No.
What the fuck is that?
I don't think so.
What did I tell you?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
No, my brother.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
What type of planes do you have?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Please, continue.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
We're half a million off.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Cocaine?  How much?
Mexico.
Yes.
Yeah, maybe.
George, you look terrible.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Dad.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
I meant every word of it.
What do you guys want?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
But this is...
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Dad.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
Where are you going?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
You swear?
Swear on my life.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
And you believe the NLF?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Third group. What's your assignment?
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
A name?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
So she knew about his heart?
Yeah.
About three hours.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Objection sustained.
Why would she want that?
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I have.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Rebecca Lawson.
Six years.
What about Miss Lawson?
How did he look?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Intense.
Why not?
Why did she say she was leaving?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
What kind of information?
No.
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
No.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Dristan nasal spray.
P.M.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Why'd you come here?
You didn't know about it before that?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Is it against the law?
You and me -- making love.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
What?
You were brilliant today.
What's that for?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
That wasn't the deal.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
I love you.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Is that alright, Frank?
What's wrong?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Why didn't you come to me?
No -- never.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
How bizarre!
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Not this kind of heat.
You want me to call the doctor?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Francesca.
Where are you staying while you're here?
He's very... clean.
Clean?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
You ought to write these stories down.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
You get used to it.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
You really don't need anyone?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Yes! Hi.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes.
No. I couldn't.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
No. Don't do this.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
You feeling better Franny?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I'm going to miss you.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Then what do you care?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Just try it.
Where are we, baby?
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
Lucky thing.
Bill!  Bill?!
No way man...
You was just doing your job.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
But --
We just thought...
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Know what?
Where is it?
We know how this was done, eh?
No!
I can't.  I can't.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, what happened?
What are you going to do with it?
That doesn't make any sense.
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Fuck.
Where, then?
What did she do to you?
Now that's teamwork.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
You're helping Rajeev?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Truck.
Thanks.
I had to see you.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
Yeah.
Then what?  Exactly.
What?
Yes.
That's his brother.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
What if he doesn't run?
No.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
-- he went inside! --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Treadstone.
What is Treadstone?
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
Keep it. 
I don't know.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
You are a friend of his?
Who?  Who came?
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Jesus...
I want to go home.
I won't hurt you.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I needed a break.
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He came to kill us.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- how? --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
Yes.
So get the hell out of here.
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- he accessed the account --
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
You telephone, sir.
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
I think we'd better have a look.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
What do I have to do.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
If I can help you ...
Jack!!
Layton! Oh shit!
How do you mean?
Not much.
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
I'm sure you have
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
You're the only person I can trust.
Take her off the list.
It could all be coincidental.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
It's my fucking life.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why not?
What's going on here?
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Let go! We've got to stop!
Leave me alone!
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
What happened to you after ...
The refund for Tuttle!
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
What?
I delivered it.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
What! Shit!
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Sam!!! 
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
No need, sir
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Sign here please.
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
No underwear?
Mary said you might be coming.
Sleeping in the back.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
You're not going to die.
No, I'd better not.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Is there any chance?
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
The first is always the best.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I think it looks good.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
That's too many.
What look?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
Where you going?
The family know?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
Shut up a second...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Yes.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
What?
No.  No.
Oh, God, no!
What did they do with you?
Hold it down, okay?
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
What happened?
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
What?
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Don't say anything about anything.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
The cost-efficient reporter.
Just a few questions?
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
It's Aaron.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Follow me.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Is everything all right?
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Why so glum?
Go ahead.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
If we could just eat first.
They said it would be okay if...
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
I've got another story.
Billion.
What do you mean clean?
Yeah?
I didn't think you'd make it.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
So what did you think?
You okay?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
I don't wan to discuss work.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
I knew what you meant.
Go ahead -- what?
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Don't you work here?
I just might.
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
I already told you I'm not.
Look at the size of it!
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Hi Walter.
May I please have another little kiss?
Goodbye.
I like you very much, Walter.
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
No! I want to talk about it now!
Why not?!
I hope this was made with egg whites!
What's the matter with you?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
A show..how soon can we go?
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
I also saw the girl give you this.
You're like an undercover guy!
Huh?!!!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Good night Walter...
I look horrible.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
You didn't like them.
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
Yes.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
What's Bobby gonna say?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
I am a God!  A God!
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
) What do you think?
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
You were supposed to be here at three.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
Wait!
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Yes.
China.
Cramps?
None of your business.  God.
Wait a minute.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Who we gonna beat?
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
How can you keep doing this?
I wish you would.
I'm curious, is all.
Vampires of the world, beware.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Wait!
That is so cool.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Nicole...
What's happening?  What do you want?
The mark of the Coven.
I'm just a girl.
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
God, I never thought of that.
What?
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
The right nostril.  Good.
Fundamentals?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
What a nasty thing to say.
I did.
He did?
We lost.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
Crash, I didn't think you--
You got me all confused.
He' s confused--
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
I got him on the knee!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Beg me!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
What?
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
And where can I go?
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
I gotta go now, Dad.
Can I give you my testimony?
Little high.
It's a league record.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
Yeah.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
All right, Ace?
In other words, I'm fucked.
In so many words, yes.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Yeah?
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
...to me.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Hello.
It's me.
No, I'm not okay.
Well...
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Okay. You come by the house?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
Now, he's really pissed.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
You're with me now.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
It's nice isn't it?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Huh?
You didn't have to beat him up!
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
I don't need one.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
Right.
Yeah.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Yeah.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
What'd you have?
What did Jennifer have?
Oh...
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Oh, you are...
I am calm!
But it was just mine.
...and hypocrisy.
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Is this yours? Your pen?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
And here. Here.
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Artie! Artie!
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
I know.
Of course, Remo.
You got a round figure on it?
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Sure.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I do.
All right?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
I don't - 
Yeah?
Mm-hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
I'm sorry.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
No, Lester.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
I just talked to him.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
They check in alone?
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Don't know.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
I'm positive.
I'm sorry.
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
In women?
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
What's the matter...
You're probably right.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
What did you say?
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Spooky.
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
I don't know what came over me.
But of course you are.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Next time, call...
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
What are you doing on Theo's line?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
He's seen both of us now.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
Make a "U" and go back.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
Got your badge?
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
What do they need her for?
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Are you okay?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Who's in back?
A typical fuck-up.
You, I would've noticed.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
I'm handling it.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Who is this?
Who are you working for?
Where do we meet?
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
We're waiting on you.
And not a nickel.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Who are you?
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
How?
She's not a girl, Col --
Persistent.
Maybe he wants something.
Who the fuck is he?
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
What look?
They're jealous.
Is this an obsession of yours?
What does that mean?
Even now.
What you doing here?
Do you care, Jimmy?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Don't.
You can always pretend.
There's Dave. He knew too.
She from Scotland too?
Don't call me that --
Why?
So tell me.
What pills?
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Not if you go.
I promise.
Thirty-five.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Have a look at him.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
You may be right.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
You OK about that?
Would make me feel better about it.
Should blow you away, you know that?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Right.
I seen your fucking face.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Do what?
What makes you think that?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
C'mere.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
She your wife?
What the fuck am I doing here.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Ever see hurling?
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Doesn't matter where.
Who's Dil?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
The fastest.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You won't run.
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
What?
Adam!
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- lyses! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- please believe me!
Reggie -- listen to me --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
You mean spies and things like that?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Very sweet.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
I believe you.
Thanks very much.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Because they're still here.
Were you followed?
Agents.
Who?
Carson?
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Oh. Then who's this one?
Are you sure there's no mistake?
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
What's your first name today?
No.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Keep going.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
What day is it?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
I'd love some, thanks.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Go on.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
What do you mean?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
Tell me what?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
No -- in my room.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
Where?
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
How do you know what they're doing?
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
I don't see him.
Yeah?
I think it's funny.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
She's my daughter, Tom.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
I want you to head right home after school.
What do you mean?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
You know where I can find her?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
You aren't going to the party?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Someone tried to kill me.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
You can't tell your parents.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Hi princess.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Where are you going?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
The word is Mob.
Yeah.
On what side of the family?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
Did you want one?
No.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
No argument there.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Except for the fact that I need cash.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Peace.
I need your truck!
Damn.
...town. 
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
You stole this truck! That's...
...-damn!

Doesn't...
 Nice job back there.
Kiss my ass!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...I believe in live and...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
Fuck! 
...we can make it.
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Oh, shit.

Hey!
 Go on.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
 Okay.  Okay. 

 Listen!  Listen...
...you're dealin' with!
...here!
Okay.  Okay.

Worth a try.
It won't even start half the time.
...or nephew or some good old boy...
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...shit.
Hey.   Mason.

Reach into my pocket.

Come here.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Oh, shit.
We!
 
It's working.
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!
 Well.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who put the big hurt on...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Patriotism is its own reward.
I think so too.
...us.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
And it won't be pleasant. 

It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I did what I could for you...
...help you?
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
...including the permanently extreme.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yes, sir.
...-lar.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now listen to me.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
All right.  After they put you away...
So far, ye-yes.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.

Radio the bikes.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Check the immediate area.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
...-ty.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...screwup?
Is this your establishment?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
Doc...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.


Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
Be sure you feed Bosco.
And don't give him any ice cream...
...somehow. 
Uh, we both like to fish.
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
...son.
Thanks. 
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
...colonel?
A man named Tim Ma-...
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...back...
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
 The only one who understands what this me-...
Yeah, I just....
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
...Mason?
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
...to talk, son.
Get in 


Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
An honest living.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
Then these are all new owners?
If that's what it says.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
None.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
How did you find out?
I've got her.
She's fine.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
I said okay, Jake.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core club.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
Yeah?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
A private investigator?
My husband's at the office.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
...Just a minute...
Well, how much would you like?
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
Is there anything else you want to know?
I mean I can't tell you.
K... Cross.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
That dam is a con job.
No.
Why?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
You can't always tell what's going on there.
What's wrong?
Your eye.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
I saw him.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
Yes.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Sure.
Upstairs. Why?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Walsh here?
I'm sorry. We don't.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Only when I breathe.
When it comes.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
No, really?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
This?
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Why'd she run away?
So I can have these? 
How's school?
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Who?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
He made an awful lot of money.
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Was the show covered by every department?
Has he said when he'll finish?
Almost two to one -
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Oh!!
You've got some on your face.
Oh!
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Half past eleven.
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Don't go, Susan.
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Get Dr. Corey.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Yes.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
Well, thanks a lot.
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
When did you get back?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Very dramatic, I thought.
Well... kind of, sort of?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
But can we date?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
It wasn't me.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Excuse me?
In a second!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Well, he missed!
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
You open?
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
What time do you have to stay till?
You called Caitlin again?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Eight and a half?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Return of the Jedi.
Blasphemy.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
And the second time around...?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
What did he say?
What's a jizz-mopper?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
How? When?
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
An embarrassing way to die.
Who found him?
I could never reach.
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
Jesus!
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Hey, what about Veronica?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Who eats cock?
Around three or something.
This life?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
What responsibility?
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Leave me alone.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Lovely story.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You need a ride?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
They are not.
No, she's getting married.
You used to go out with her?
Veronica.
Actually, that's his night job.
I'm trying.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
She called you, didn't she?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
It better be up to and including me.
Three?
Three including you.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
All right. Name it.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
You sucked his dick!
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
Here you go.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
What are you talking about?
Is he staying here?
I do about three-fifty, four.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
To an Asian design major.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
Sure. How about the beach?
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I hope it feels good.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I'm not sad.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Which one?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
I don't know.
I copy.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Glad you could drop in.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
I'm going with you.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Hello, Gabriel.
Did I miss something?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
From one professional to another, of course.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
You got to go back now!
For the same reason you did, to help.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
It was great.
You attacked me.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Want me to lead?
No luck?
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Just kidding.
I burned it.
You said there was a way across.
Have her come up.
Who's going with you?
What the hell are you doing--
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Why didn't you send the money over?
What's the code, Travers?
Appreciate it.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
I've been cured.
Thank you, sir.
Much better, thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Who said that?
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Do you mean Church of England?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Vitamins will it be then?
You've heard Beethoven before?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Don't read it - sign it!
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Hullo, son, how are you?
Shall we go to my office?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Big case?
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
...he's two floors below you.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
What kind of question?
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Something going on?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Elvis?
I'm in town for a short time.
Try?
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
Yo, whassup?
Yeah?
First time in New York?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Max.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
What about that?
You said you were visiting friends!
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Get rid of 'em.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Why?
Who's that?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
What?
Vincent?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Let's go.
Max?  What are you doing?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Why?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
I don't know.
Who's Heller?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Head towards Union Station.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
None of your business.
That's love.
Mississippi?
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I think you're different.
What was your horse's name?
You bit someone's nose off?
People do have heart attacks.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Arf... You gotta help me.
What is it with you and the space program?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Pretty scary, huh?
Shoot.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Murdered?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
What is it?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Did you kill my father?!
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
I love you, too.
I'm a very patient man.
That's great.  Good for you.
You made your decision yet?
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
Which way did he go?
Can I talk to you a second?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
You're --
Ellie...
What?  Why?
Ellie.
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
How can that be?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
But what about your research -- ?
Ellie.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
How do you mean?
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Ellie, what is it?
What are you so afraid of?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
I do.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Yeah.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Git to work!
You got your mind right, Luke?
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Here's the Patrol.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
A cold drink? Okay?
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
We'll get the paramedics...
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
She's supposed to have it.
What book?
Who was the man in the basement?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
No.  Not yet.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
We've got another one.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
Open the door.  Please.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Okay.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
It's none of my business anymore...
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Classy madonna.
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
What the hell you need her for?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
He's not treating her right...
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
There, that's better.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
No. But when he's in that car...
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
What's up with you?
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
You look beautiful.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
Mom, please.
You too, Mom.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
I'm really not that hungry.
Yeah?
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
A small price.
Don't be ridiculous.
A daisy for the lady.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
Tell the doctor.
Then it's over.
Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Are you OK?
How may I help you?
What do you mean not taking your meds?
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I guess I should go now.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
Especially this last year.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
No, no.
You what?
I've met someone else.
Getting back.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
A pass.
They don't have a murder weapon?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Who?
No.
You're calling me on is phone?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
Good.   I'm good.
No thank you.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
I'm not here to negotiate.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
Thank you.
Turn on the flashlight.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
You're sure?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
All right, knock it off.
Anybody hungry?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I will.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Everything.
Boy, you must be pissed.
What'd you guys find?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
The map said to go left.
Yes.
They don't serve wine here.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
God, I want to go home.
Get in the car.
No.   It's mine.
Mr. Zammito?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
J&amp;B?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
Sounds boring.
Why?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
What's this?
It's for you.
Okay.    Okay.
Then leave her to me.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
On guard!
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Hello.  What is your name?
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
I'm tired now.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Here you must be in proper attire.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Give it back!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
I will.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Don't you want to see her again.
But don't be too lenient.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
But the sword could be in his compound.
No onions?
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
You're welcome.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
I can pick out a tune now and again.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
I went to see a friend of mine.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Top Dollar.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Miss her?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
You'll be alone.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
At this hour? I don't think so.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Need a lift?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
You don't even know me.
Yes.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay.
You must take me for a real idiot.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Hi.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
What do you mean?
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
What are the boys like?
What are you scared of?
Okay.
Okay.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
No.
What do I do then?
That's one way of looking at it.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
You think he'll like it?
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Where are you going?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Who told you?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
One.
Pleased to meet you.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Interesting.
Who are you calling?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
She shot you down.
So what went wrong?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Bad time?
No, tell me.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
It clearly is why.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Not at all. What's wrong?
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Did she show up?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
You get your wish!
What are saying, darling?
Where did you get this ring?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Did you hear the child out?
Well, it seemed to me --
What is it, Alice?
Amy, not that old tree!
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
I didn't forget.
They ran away.
These are all from me.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
No.
Can't you get it, darling?
That's right!
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
But she's dead!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
But she's such a nice lady.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
I like stories.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
What else is there?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
He's a very talented musician.
Where?
Hey, did you get contacts?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
So did you do it?
Charming Carlton.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Why not? There's been a murder.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
No.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Peter knows something.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
Hello?
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You don't have to pee.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Mark.
Script coverage?
No.
It's stupid.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Everything okay?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Except Mark of course.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Is it that funny?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
Here's a towel.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
You want her sheets?
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
We only live a few blocks apart.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
How long have you been here?
The other one?
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Good evening, sir.
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Sorry, sir.
You typed this report?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
But...  How long has this been happening?
What is that door?
No.  I, ah...
Someones after me.
Shut up!
Can I get my life back?
You've been working too hard.
For a month.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
That shelter was in this bill.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
TilT we figure something out.
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Check his kids.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
When does it break?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
They could put you in jail.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
At a press conference.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Dave...
President vetoes works bill?
This is wrong, Alan!
Wrong...
What do you mean?
Oh... Hi.
Really?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Where are you going?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
What?
You find people jobs?
Well I guess...
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
You really believe that?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Sir. It's quite clear that...
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Oh, I have no doubt.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
At Chet Danburry's house.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Yes sir.
I'm not?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
But...
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Where'd you find them?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
It does?  What?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
No.
Chris!
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
AHHHHHH!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
Any group pictures in the annual?
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Todd, what's the matter?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
No thanks.
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
I'm not staying here!
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
You don't have to be so touchy.
You people...rich people...
I'm not rich people.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
No...
I don't know...you got what we need?
I have been.
And what have you come up with?
Where are you going?
Check it out!
Damn right!
What?
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
You're full of shit!
What the --!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
I know! I fuckin' know!
You don't!
No.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Hey, Nick...
No?
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
How are you?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
No-o-o!
What are you doing?
C'mon. I've got the car.
I... No. You do this for money?
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
The shot?
I don't think about the shot that much.
Nick, he just came back.
From Nam?
Pow.
From Nam?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
What are you, hoping?
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Forget Sal.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Watch it, shithead!
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
You didn't get a deer?
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
Up I would say... What would you say?
Down I would say... What would you say?
What did you say?
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Kimberly!
My man Dubbs.
Funny guy.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
You're working a partner on this.
I'm wasting time.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Fine.
You okay?
How do I look?
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
But Sergeant...
Does it drive itself, too?
I have to go home, Sanchez.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
You need anything else?
Good night, Wade.
You want to be a good detective?
Yes, sir.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
I'm here.
I just heard.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
They always are.
You're lying.
You know that you're in my house.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
But I like the new one better.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Sure am.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Oh!
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Not all of it?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Jabez!
It feels fine now, Jabez.
You'll never change -- will you?
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
I say -- it don't matter.
Ma -- is she? --
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Come in, Sheriff.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
You aren't angry with me?
It is.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
I'm John McClane.
It's okay, it's okay.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
You're all right, Argyle.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Hans.  Your Hans.
Put it down now.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Go on.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Holly Gennero?
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
How do you know?
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Is that him?
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
Gene -- you smilin'?
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
Yes, I would.
Heidi, I'm dying.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Hey, don't take the car!
How are you doing?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
What am I supposed to do?
Denmark?  Sweden?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
You don't have a choice?
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
What do you want to know that for?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
What do you want?
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
They were ...
Yeah ...
Yeah?
You got kids?
What?
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
They look like good kids.
You like me?
Did you always call him Junior.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
What?
I want him to think that.
I want him to think that.
We'd kill ourselves.
I never been up in a plane before.
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Sal?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
What can he do, he's clean...
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Hey, let's get ready!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!
Maybe...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
Okay.
Hello?
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Must you use that awful word?
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Cool it, Choco.
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
I don't like anything else.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
Yo!
Yes?
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
You the man.
You're a drunk fool.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
How come you're not at Sal's?
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
...peanuts.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Let it be broke.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Sal, I want my money.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
You keep it.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
I can't be staying long anyway.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Mister Seor Love Daddy is cool.
Ya like him, huh?
I was going to buy a slice.
I understand.
Some are OK.
I love you.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Pop asked you.
Take it easy, Pop.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
I don't follow.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, it's a treasure map.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Oh, is this your special place?
Can we eat there tomorrow?
According to the map, we're just about at school.
How do you know it's for us?
Sure I do. On one condition.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
You have beautiful eyes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
I know I did.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
A float!
Ready Lloyd?
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Oh, you're good.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
You really are a pirate.
How much homework is there?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
You know I do!
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
I am strong!
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Are you going to kill her?
Love it!
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
Remove her gag!
Where are we do you think?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
What is it?
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
The <u>women</u>?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Are you sure this is okay?
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
What is this place?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
So why didn't you do it?
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Don't you have any savings?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
What happened?!
And, cut...
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
What do you think you're doin'?!
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
You met Basil Rathbone!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
That's right...
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Mr. Wood?!
Hruphh...?
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Are you a fruit?
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
I am.  How's your father?
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
What's uncanny?
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
What octopus motor?
B-but it's our money --
Why... yes.
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Who?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
No.
Yes!
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
I'm moving out.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Uh-huh?
They tore her dress! ...
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Mr. Pekurny.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Who?
Al!
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
And what did he come back now for?
Eddie...
What happened?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Hi, Mom. 
She left.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
I mean bad.
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Shari...
No. Who?
Really? 
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
It's not their fault.
This is going right up your ass.
Kinda'.
What did you do to your hair?
What are you drunk?
I got your message. Way to go!
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
What's the dif --
Hi, Shari.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
Ed... I'm sorry.
That girl's an idiot.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Ohhh...
That's the point -- this could change things.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
What?
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Yeah?
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
NO, that's fine
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
Why are you lecturing me?
What do you mean?
Hello, Mr. M.
Where to?
Why are you doing this?
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Walt needs to see you.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
This weekend.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Okay, let's say
What?
What...?
People can see this.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Now could you leave me alone?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Tell me about Patchett.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
When they deserve it.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
This business, Captain?
Captain, what do you want?
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
What was that boyfriend's name?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
More.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
More or less.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
I need to speak to you.
You make a mistake?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Really?  What did White say?
Why not?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
A sweet man.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
You're back, boychick.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Working whores with squad two.
DePinto's dead.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
Turn on CNN.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
I'm doing a transfer now.
Why?
I don't know who he is.
I don't know what that means.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
Look, my wife is understandably--
What'd I tell you?
Jesus.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
What do you think?
Looks like Detroit.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
No he won't.
Goddammit--
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if--
What if <u>what</u>?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Law enforcement?
That's fine.
I'll be right back.
Why?
A police report.
You tell me.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
You should take this seriously.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
Stacy--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
That was for Christmas.
Sir?
Why the hell would I--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
DePinto?
It's how he works.
You're not.
Why?
Bullshit.
I can't.
I've never met him?
--otherwise we may have to--
Where's mom?
How long can you stay?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Jerry--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
No, I--
I have a family.
Jerry?
Are you still in Crystal City?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
What is it you want?
Dean's with Lyle.
So they know everything.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
What's your ETA?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
No.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
As the wife of one of our party.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
You sing.  All the time.
What's this?
You should come into the shelter.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Don't.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Say you're sick.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Shall we be all right?
I know.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
What did you do?
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Is this you?
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Hana tells me you're leaving.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Apprentices.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
To arm-twisting.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Candaules
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Are you remembering more?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
That's a different dress.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
You'd better be.
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
You get Hardy.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
Kip - come and dance with me
I try not to expect you.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Meaning--
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
I have a question...
Who am I?
Uh. I'm showing off.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You disappeared.
I've got something...
So what?
Maybe I should drive this time.
He says they turned the card down.
What about your bags?
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
True enough.
I didn't mean to get personal.
So how long to pop the floor?
That's it. We're ready.
Terrified. Still am.
One, two, three...
You can't be too careful.
Careful...careful.
The big job.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
No way to take another day or two?
The sign of our partnership.
Jesus God, it's going through.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
It's too soon.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
What's she doing here?
There's more than one?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
The judge came up with a number.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
If you hadn't used profanity --
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Excuse me?
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Bullshit.
What now?
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Whoa.  No shit.
So what are you thinking?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
I was wrong.
I did.  Both.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
You see your office?
When'd they file the demur?
Who's the judge?
Did he say why?
And you were told to destroy those?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
Randy's mom said yes right away.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Why not?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Thanks for reminding me.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
What do you want, a joke?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
Thinking.
What time is it?
I'm embarrassed.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
There's something else, too.
What?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Barks his consternation.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
Sit down, and shut up!
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
What are you afraid of?
Are you crazy!
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
Can you trust him?
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
About what?
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Thanks.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Closer?!
I thought I was in good shape.
I can't. It's too big.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
Nobody's going to believe it.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
What are they doing here?
Primitive?
Please
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Can you land?
What's the little black box do?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Get this crap out of me.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Where do I put ashore?
Locked.
75% power.
Got a smoke?
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
I said pull over.
Not yet.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
The freeway.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
So be it, to the death.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Guenevere...
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
Father...
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
It is.
I'm not jealous!
I am the desert, where water disappears--
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Now you must pay me.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Hi, how'd your day go?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
What didn't he tell you?
What did the doctor say?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
What is it?
I'm gonna miss you.
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
No. No rats.
There is nothing.
Is it coming out Willie?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Depression?
Lies?
Sure did.
No.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Have you told him what's happening?
What's the difference?
When can I have one?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Who's Captain Howdy?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Regan, why are you reading that?
Cause I like it.
Yeah
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Another one. Had your lunch?
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
No.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
I once did a paper on it
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Is that a threat?
Very much.
Are you comfortable Regan?
Who is it?
Give me the keys!
Frankie.
Yeah, come on in.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Well, look at this.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
What do you do to him?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Get your hand off me.
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Oh my God ...
Count it.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
Talk.
That's what we agreed.
What's that?
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
What's the matter?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
Just a lucky guess.
First night?
I thought we all had separate rooms.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
We're gonna be here a week?
Doesn't it matter to you?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
Celebrating.  Join me?
The party's over.
Expensive hangover.
You could've come.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
You're making things up, Frank.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
What're you doing?
Cancel, Frank.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
What disease?
You don't know?
Seventy-one
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Right.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Yeah?
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
You're an hour and a half late.
We ran long.
Ready?
We're a team.  We work together.
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
What's he talking about?
Do I look like I'm naked?
A seven.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Fucking.
Hey!
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Maybe it's legit.
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Baker's unabridged.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
I don't believe it.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Thanks, Lloyd.
I'll call you.
How come?
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
The name's Baker --
Save it.  What's he look like?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
And you don't?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Forget it.
It's okay.  Last one.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
How do you do it? Every night?
Nothing.
Who's Nina?
Soap?
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
How do you know?
Why not?
What's a prom?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
From Hurley's?
So. How are you?
Fine.  You?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Fine work, Jon.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
My place.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
And this thing can grow it?
Or reactivated the first one.
Hey, bro ...
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
We need to talk.
It's important.
Must've been after we got engaged.
So you had a nightmare.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
They're too tight.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
I'm just having some fun.
Gone?
You're wearing your suit --
What are you doing?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Jack, are you okay?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
They did a pretty good job.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Yeah?  What do you need?
What?!
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
Ive got kids, Im going home...
Like the dress...?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
All in one tape?
For us, Kate.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
But its twenty degrees outside...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
What...?
Maybe I should wait...
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
Thats a big one for me, too.
Youre so...beautiful...
I could stay here forever...
A perk for what?
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Kate...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Are you alright?
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Then what is it?
Leonard, how's the feed?
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
That's what we're here to find out.
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
It's just business.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
What can we do?
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
What's that?
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
You said there was a quick way out!
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
Any reserve air?
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What's wrong, Skipper?
The Wall's transparent...
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
No Jean, no money!
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
...Blood has been shed.
We need more -
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Yah.
Officer Olson.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Oh sure.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Yeah!
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
You bet.
Yeah, but -
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Jerry Lundegaard.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
It's okay, Scotty.
Shep said 8:30.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
...There's a million dollars here!
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah - how are you doon?
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
No, no, that's fine.
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Nope.
So?
...Hello?
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Yah.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Oh, fine.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
Cornelius!  How are you?
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
I'll take the parasites.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
When?
Marla...
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Marla...
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Hello?
How have you been?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
Well, I have to file a claim...
A hotel?
Yeah.
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
What?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
What fight?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
I said I promise!
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
What is this place?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
I feel sick.
... is over.
Four in Milwaukee.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why did you do that?
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
What about Marla?
I'm going to...
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
You want out?
Please...
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
What's going on here?
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
It's only the end of June.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
I'm... really sorry.
4:25.
Most kids do, I guess.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
No! No! Don't!
I'm sorry we broke in.
What are you doing?
Get control of yourself!
What's that?
That's what I'm here for.
What's this?
No.
How you doing, Brewer?
American?
That guy's not going to make it.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Where did you find this clown?
Intelligence work.
I know.  I go with you.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
It's not necessary.
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Colonel.
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
I... You're not going to understand this.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
... What?... You don't want to commute?
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Tragedy?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Remember. One chorus and out.
.....Me neither.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
How un-sixties of you.
Huh-huh.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well there....  What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Now what?
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
<u>What</u>?!
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Happily married, probably.
Holdin' my penis...
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
I don't drink coffee...
Well, id'n that nice.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Tea.
Robert Eroica...
Now don't...
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
You know who it once belonged to?
Robert...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Why are you being so mean?
It's none of your business!
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
No, don't do that...
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
What?
No, it's okay.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I don't think that's true.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I hope I didn't hear that.
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
Mass production is what does it.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
What?
Wussup?
So you got a girl?
Of course.
How you treat them?
Come down!
Who gives!
Wussup?
They are?
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
My friend told me she lived around here.
I'm a good friend of hers.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
I have no idea.
Fletch!
What? What are you talking about?
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Fletch...
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Right.
Ten days ago?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Its okay. The cops did it.
Fletch?
We can't talk about it here.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I'm still here.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Yo!
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Did you say cops?
Yeah.
I'm sorry?
No, thank you.
So were my parents.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Why'd you let me in?
What is this?
What are you talking about?
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
I was afraid you'd say that.
Don't tell me I can't --
I'm terrified.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
What did you want under the bed?
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
What...
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Who's your decorator?
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
I'll do my best.
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
All your friends call you Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
I don't know, what was the case?
I came to warn you...
What an interface!
Hello?
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Are you okay?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Like me.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Polo.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
You're that guy, the private eye.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
That's funny, you're cute.
I'm clean.
No - no.
What?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Le sommes nous?
There'll be someone else.
You're in show business.
What?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
What's he do?
That's in France.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
What is that old building?
What are you saying?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Frank, we need to talk...
Deleon.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
Hello?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
No, not yet.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
What are you talking about?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Go in where?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Gordo?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
What?
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
The 2-3.  Homicide.
Who the fuck is this?
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Why don't we go take a swim?
What're you doing?
How do we do it?
Which one is it?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
Faster!  Eat faster!
Why don't you help us?
Yes.
Bullseye!
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Is that all you found?
Whaddya mean?
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
There...Ya happy?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
So let's talk.
Steven...
I'm here.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Legs giving you trouble?
Ed...
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
You're talking about my lady.
Sorry.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Okay.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
That was truly excellent.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
But Sean said...
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Say it again.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
Shut up, Elliot.
Press a button and they give us money.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
And he was there?
What was it like?
We're making too much of this.
Had to be him.
Of course I saw it.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
I talked to her two days ago.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
See, Daddy.
What else?
See, Daddy.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
Who is it?
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
How come you got the kid with you?
What am I doing?
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Life is good.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
hat was this morning.
'm not worried about this kid.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Mine was cobalt blue.
Yes.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
"Hell!"
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
And Jinnah?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
It's beautiful.
Hm.  Is it?
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
It's split the Government.
I dined at the prison.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Er, no...
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
Something's not right.
What are you waiting for?
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
Who died?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
You really had other offers?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Yes.
Friend?
You'll be next.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
--when you go away.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What are you doing?
All it takes is a long arm.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Hello, Doc.
You okay?
What's Beynon got set up?
I've been doing my homework.
That's not all of it.
It's all right.
I'll be okay.
$250,000 right off the top.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
When we had trouble before it was different.
You've got it all figured.
Okay.
Yeah.
Are we going to make it?
That's right.
No, I'm afraid not.
Can I help you?
All right. Shells?
Yeah. I got out.
I'm good at that.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Then you do it.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
Can he trust you?
What's the damage?
Yes.
What happened to this car?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Jack?
That's nice.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Who paid you to see me off?
I can't Jack. How can I?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Address?
Can I go now?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
Yes.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
What was bugging Frank?
It is. Honestly.
Yes, while he was here.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
And what was that?
You've been watching the film.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Nice of you to come.
Sorry about your father.
At me friend's house.
What?
Who's Brumby?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
Now just a minute...
No chance of that.
Not much.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Meaning what?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Scotch, please.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Not going, Jack?
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
What's that?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
What's that?
Deadbeats all.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You did?
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
For some sales pro...
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
What?
You...
You build it!
Yes...?
How do you know he'd buy them?
Is that what I said?
A buck a shot.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would I do it?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Yes.  I'm sure.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
I didn't ask to be.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
You went for it.
Fine.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Yes.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
That they're going to be upset.
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
Would you come in here, please?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Not lately it isn't.
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
...they kicked out.
I will close.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Is that what you're saying?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
You robbed the office.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
I...
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
Only the beginning...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
When?
They took the leads?
Fuck you care...?
Twelve-fifteen.
What?
Me.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I told you.
She told me I have to.
No, Jim.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
It's nothing.
Guess who?
Why not?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
They didn't get my contracts.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Three.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
I understand...
I want you to help me, Fredo.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
...Who?
And you believed that story.
He's an Italian?
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Kay... Kay...
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
You're going to talk to him now.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Mikey, I hoped...
Wait... there's something else.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
How's the baby?
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
The baby I lost...
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
Not for a few years.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
How is his health?
That is a complete falsehood.
When do we talk?
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I thought we would meet alone.
Turnbull is a good man.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
What if I say shove it?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
What's this?
Yes.
Just thinking out loud.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
What's to be jealous of?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
What're you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
I'm not married.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
We have his note.
Mornin'.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Huh?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Football in college.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Did you now?
Did anyone laugh?
No.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
Everybody has stories to tell.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
This was World War I?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
You asked me to model.  Remember?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
No harm done.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
No.  The girl.
It's not like her.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
Never gave it much thought.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
You only embarrass yourself.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
She is horrible.
Does the yardman come today?
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Yes?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
I don't mind.
Then the rumors are true?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
What kind of job... ?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You know my back -
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I know you.
I'm on the move -
What's the matter?
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
Dignity...
There's no one left ...
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
You, too, Ma...
No.
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
You guys are through...
Whatcha got left ... ?
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Cool. So you're living up North?
Yeah -
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
Hey, now -
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Me.
You don't think so, huh?
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What?
What are you doing here?
Where we going -- ?
Call 911 -
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
What's with the look?
Buy you a drink?
"Mitch?"
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
That what you want?
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
What's that?
You remember Junie?
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Some crew you got ...
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Which way's out, man -- ?
What? What happened?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
What are you gonna do?
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
You know. The stuff I left.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
You want the melon?
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
I can't make any more deliveries.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Are you okay? What happened?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
But, Paulie, please.
No way! You're kiddin'!
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
What do we got?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Okay.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Chuck, let's go.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Will you take a check?
History.
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
What is it?
You're in a safe place, Will.
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Which one's your building?
Really?
Get out, Will.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
I can come back.
Will.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Sean.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
I got it.
Tom.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
You moved?
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
Oh, that's nice--
--I'm not angry at you--
--I don't have any anger at you--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
About thirty million to one.
What did you think?
You think so?
285.
Crayons?
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
What?
Define that.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
I didn't ask for this.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I kind of got that impression.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
Yes you were.
How was that?
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I swear to God.
Do you know all their names?
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
I've never seen your place.
Exactly.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
When?
No.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Like me?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
Ready, Ma?
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Lots must a died, too.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Any gas?
Gallon or two?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Four.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
I ain't gonna run.
You're right!
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I stay in my own yard.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
But will it--hurt the baby?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Look, Ma!
How's it feel, Tommy?
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
Tommy?
Well?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Computer guy.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
What am I gonna do?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Bad experiences.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
...Let me get my coat.
Shoulda brought my gun.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
That's probably a good idea.
You don't understand...
I just know.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
That's strictly Bader-Meinhof stuff.
It was the PLO.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Wait a minute--
That's going to cost.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
What's it look like?
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
To shoot you. Correct.
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
What?
He's beautiful.
Poor thing.
Thanks.
Son?
How did you meet her?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Mom?
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Did you ask him to come visit?
About what?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
Started what?
What?... Oh baby...
Let's bring your bags inside.
What did he say?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Good night.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
No. I am a "tubab."
Was the trip okay?
Where does this go, Diane?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
I'd love to go there one time...
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Diane!
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
I don't believe it.
Tom?
Of course I have.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I can't... not yet...
Grace, I need you to come with me.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
We still have a way to go.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
You ever miss it?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Cool?
She's rabid, but cute.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
And what's he do?
Dade?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Revenge.
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Yo, showtime, showtime!
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
Your slave?
Make it our first date.
I know, I know who wrote it.
Shit!!
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
You're welcome.
Never fear. I is here.
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Real charmer.
Okay sure. What about?
We've been better.
Not without Jamie.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
What does that mean?
Go!
When did this happen?
Honey, I don't think their home.
Why wasn't I notified?
About what?
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Double scoops?
Then we'll be safe?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Why?
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Where are you going?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
132 to 133 this is 134.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
He's been here.
Where's that Deputy?
It's over.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
It's been totally charted.
Why did you hang up on me?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
You still spooked?
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Wait a minute here...
Get him out of here!
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Yes.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
I wonder where they went.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I gotta go.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Anybody live here?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
What do we do?
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
Where?
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Is Annie around?
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Okay. Later.
Are you sure?
Are there any special instructions?
...any sister talk?
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
You want to see some?
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh!
Oh, is that what it is?
Yeah.
Uh...
What?
You're Holly.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Yes, but you name names.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Yes.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Well, sure.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Oh.
He's got like six gold records.
Elliot!  Don't!
Why?
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
I can't say anything!
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
This is not an easy situation.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Is something wrong?
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you in love with someone else?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Mmm...
Hmm?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Like what?
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Oh, Jesus!
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Doesn't she look pretty?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Really?
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Hi!  Hi!
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Yeah?
I think so.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...you know?  I, uh...
Oh!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Don't you think she does?
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oooo.
Uh-huh.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Awwww...
No!
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Yes, you do recall, right?
Good.  How are you?
You look wonderful.
Yeah.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
No, I haven't.
You're okay, though, huh?
Really?
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Dad...
...read it over, and think about it.
...you don't have to think.
And?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
You want me to be?
C'mon, pal.
Then you tell me, then.
...the whole world's out to get you...
How crazy is that.
That's right.
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
He escaped...
What do you want me to do?
He is...?
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I can make you rich.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
For a consideration.
Shut up, Starling...
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Said what?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
My scar is a war-wound.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
No. 
We got KittyKat...
I came to pay my...
...may be the heat....
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
...what?
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Then we cannot go.
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
Hey, lost again.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then tell me.
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Yes.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
That's right.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Talia, don't go!
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Do you really not believe in God?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Sorry Veronica.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Oh, I have to hear this.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
I said I was sorry.
No way, no day!
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
I don't know. Should you?
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
Do you take German?
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
It doesn't work on small animals!
Oh.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Did not.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
I thought I...you..
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Turn that back on!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Hello!
He's the manager!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
Look, Mother!
That's coming along well!
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Isn't it beautiful!
It's inside a moving car.
Second most common?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Hello I'm Dr...
You could say that.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
But... I thought...
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Really, why's that?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Morgue...?
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
What do you want?!
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Poor Trevor.
This game is over do you hear me?
What's under that sheet...?
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Wait... what the hell is this...
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
You got a drinking problem or what?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
I got your bail continued.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Mister LaPlante...
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Nothin'.
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Me!
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
That's not what I mean...
John, I know all about it.
"A little mistake"!
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Unprofessional.
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
How'd it go?
Said he's not an actor.
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
Reporters don't have hormones?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Okay.
And the rent is okay?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
That would be stupid.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Oh, great.
Everything breaks at once.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
What happened?
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Honey --
Neil, calm down.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
We're going to think about it.
How were we -- were we cool?
No.
I hear things in this house,
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
God, your sister's really hot.
What for, dickweed?
What about cable?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
I have a cold.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Lieutenant?
What is it?
We don't have any proof of that.
She was a good woman.
You sure?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Who are you?
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
What?
That is what bothers me.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
What are we doing here?
To ask her to dance.
What worries you?
No -- I will.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
I cannot stay.
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Corpses?
A lucky guess.
You got me.
You're hurt.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Be careful, Conner.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
I was working on the cataloging.
I love you, Conner.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Fine.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
You get anything on Smith?
What do you want to do?
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
I guess not.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Okay.
Use more ice.
How did you get this number?
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Please get away from me.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Go, Chief.
Go.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Go, Mickey.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
It's mine.  Talley.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
Special Agent Jones.
Can you get into the office?
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
These disks . . . where are they?
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Who are you?
And four children?
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
The police are very busy.
No, sir.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
We are better here.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Satellite feed.
Very soon.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
You are the manager?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Your brother's here?
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
I couldn't help.
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Oh, my God!
Has Roger spoken yet?
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
You cannot go alone.
I have a confession. When we met...
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I will not leave without the twins.
What's wrong?
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
Thank you, sir.
Paul. Are you alright?
Why the hurry, Roger?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Where?
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Jesus H. Christ!
There must be some other way out.
I'm sorry --
'Less the place really is haunted.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
Oh. Jesus.
If you know where it is, get there!
I'll meet you down there.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
Don't think it's even an issue.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Where did it go?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
What are you talking about?
Where is she?
-- I pose you the same question --
-- and who's next on your list?
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
No, no, it's just --
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
And then what happens?
First time for everything.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Vannacutt!!
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
What is it??
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
He must've unsealed the room!
Keep talking, I'll find you!
-- I'm coming --
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
They don't build them like this anymore.
By killing them?
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Where is she now?
Can I have this room daddy?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
I just, I don't know...
...set up some more things.
The heater's here.
A friend?
How are we doing?
She's gone!
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
You must be a Londrigan.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
What was she afraid of?
What...amulet?
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
There's something in there.
Well what is it!
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Sure.  Why?
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Yes.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
But I said I was sorry....
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Hit me with your best shot.
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
That's what you theenk.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
If you do anything to my friend...
It's hardly the same --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
-- or lack thereof?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh, is that it!
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...Certain people are --
...Huh?
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
You mean you know about this?
Now, Aim --
Sez who?
Ya know, entry level!
I got big ideas, though!
I'm sure you do.
Terrific.
But, buddy --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
...You don't?
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
But, sir! --
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Ya don't say.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
But, Mrs. Rand --
But you didn't have to come up here.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
She can never be cured?
You're single?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
I wish I hadn't heard --
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
I suppose so.  Yes.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
I told you.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
You all right there?
The turkey in?
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
I'm not surprised.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
So how's school treating you?
Fascist!
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Hi mom.
It's really quite all right.
Forget what?
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Do what?
What?
What do you mean?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
I don't ever want to see you.
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Yes, sir.
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Thanks.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Forget your pager?
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
Fred Duggar?
I'm not expecting anyone.
Did you love her?
What kind of stuff?
Ran like hell to go to him...
You want me to take you somewhere?
It was like some big fucking secret!
What was it?
No game.
I suppose.
What about him?
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
I told you that was an accident!
Then so was mine...
Surely you know the one who made you...
Your lover.
Yes... My God...
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You didn't even warm them, did you?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
I didn't realise.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
Not you my dear.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
But if she dies...
What do you mean?
How do you mean, start?
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
And if I don't?
Fascination...
Read her thoughts.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
Paris? You came from Paris?
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Why do you do this Lestat?
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Shall we go on?
He did it to make you stay with him!
But why did you tell her?
No... it can't end like that...
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
And the child who did die?
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
The number's unlisted...
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
I don't know...
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Checking the locks again?
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Voodoo.
I don't know.
The shower again?
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
To get out of Southport?
Deep breaths --
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
It's...him.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
Must have missed the sign.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
Where'd Estes go?
Drunk again?
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
Whet do you mean?
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..
Hero?
But the war, the army  they need you.
You are my friend.
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Well, tell, him.
I can't.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Then foreclose!
George . . .
Go through with what?
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Sit down? What are . . .
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Thank you very much.
What's that?
Hey, Ernie!
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Hee-haw!
What boat you sailing on?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
No.
Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Hello, Violet.
Nothing.
Violet Bick!
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
When?
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
I don't like coconuts.
Well, I don't.
Well, why don't you say it?
How's that?
Would you rather leave?
Hi.
I've eaten.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Huh?
For me...?
Great!  Find one for me.
Someone pop your balloon?
Maybe by now they are.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Happy to do it.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Mike's out there.
Yeah?
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Is that what it is?
What's that supposed to mean?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Sound?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Eat Cheerios.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Careful.  What's wrong?
No.
I know what you're going to say.
What're you going to do today?
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
That's you.
What's wrong?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Terry!  You okay?
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
Anyone know what time it is?
Nope.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Wave to my son.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
Absolutely.  Good idea.
It's Miller time!
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Thank you.
What is it, 97 days?
Don't forget you have your brother.
It's his work.
They're coming with us?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Where are you going?
Michael...
After what happened to us?
Sounds wonderful.
You don't.
They said you'd be here.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
No,  I'm not going through there.
It's too soon to move him.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
Nobody told me.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I'm sorry.
I will.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
He's big as a bloody bus!
She, Mister Hutton.
When did this happen?
Sure.  No problem.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
I don't know, what else is there?
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
No, think of something else.
No...  It can't be.
The space shuttle has landed!
Now what?
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Reach for the limit I always say.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Look great, don't I?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
That bugger moves fast.
But you always let me....
No way....
Like mother, like son....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
What's wrong?  What happened?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
You knew...?
I can't help it....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
That....
I see what you're doing....
The fish.  Check it....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
In a minute....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
I have to get this finished.
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
There's nothing to worry about....
It got him....
Flies the plane....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
Sure you can....
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
Why?
Hurry!
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Can't this thing go any faster?
Yeah....
She's a tough lady....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Stop busting my hump....
How many...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
What happened to Clarence and...?
When I invited you...
Okay...we got it together....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
You sure you've done this before?
How long have you known Hoagie?
What?
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
How come only me?
'A Moray eel....'
Shove it....
Here it comes....
She's in management....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Yes.
Yeah?
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
We're going.
Why?
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
That isn't what you said before.
You believe me, don't you?
Did I say he did?
You don't really believe this?
Ease off, John ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
How do you know her hair's black?
Three or four.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Did he get you the job?
No .. But we have a theory ..
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
You must have some idea about him.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
Oh.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Just your age.
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
You're looking worried again, Helena?
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
I think they're gonna arrest me.
You got a warrant for this?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Could you just stop moving?
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Do you have something to drink?
Well.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Tell me -- let me help --
I don't need you to "stick."
I don't like to give up.
I heard.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
No.
You're telling me to dance.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
The kid is amazing.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Damn right.
I think so.
I'll go back to them.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Young adult.
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
PAUL!
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
That does sound lucky.
We need to keep moving.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
He used to know me.
You remember the sounds they made?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
I'd better get going.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I want to be an astronaut.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Minimal.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Resentful.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
Their what?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
I have to find Kelly!
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
What?  No menthol?
Did I say jerk?
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Once we have control again we - -
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
The what?
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
- - like birds - -
- - a gizzard - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
Why not?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Yes?
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Are they heavy?
Yeah.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
That's a good idea.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
I didn't say I was scared.
What?  What can we do?
For today, I guarantee it.
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Ah - - they're here.
Tim!  Lex!
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Don't do that!
Your silence intrigues me.
Hello?
You want to put in chain saws?
Jesus Christ!
Quite a circus.
What?
What?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Are you going to plead insanity?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Doesnit sleep?
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
So?
None of that's true?
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
How do we prove it?
Me too. I'm drunk.
Fascinating.
Great.	When can you do it?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
We're down to seven minutes.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
Was there something else?
Hello again.
I've never seen you here before.
How long were you and Eduard --
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Are you free tonight?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
They're not obliged to tell.
You don't believe that.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
-- Listen to me --
What did she say?
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
May I ask where your two warders are?
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
It's gone out so quickly?
All these in the last year?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
I photographed it extensively, father.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Can you fly?
It's the same image - Kong!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Native costume?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Yeah.
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Uh uh.
She was with you after she left Frank.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
-- We can talk --
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
No.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Is there anything more I could --
And I don't think that was Tom.
Mm.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
I don't get you.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
You and I -- a relationship.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
What?
OK.
How is it back there?
Yeah.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Have you discussed this with them?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
Think this is our guy?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
What else do you know?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Nobody's seen that.
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Where is the child?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
Yeah?
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
All it is is onions and gravy.
I'm allergic to onions.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Is mom ever coming back?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
It's my name too.
Uh huh...
Did mommy ever see this?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Who will read me my stories?
Six years.
No, I did not.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
What about Billy?
Where are you going?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
And?
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
John?
No, but--
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
She ever ask about me?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
You heard anything yet?
All quiet?
Mama, my story.
And you have horses? You love horses.
I will not approve it.
Soon.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I will be back in a few days.
How many?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Can India help us?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
Good day.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
I leave tomorrow.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
You cannot.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
This is Britain.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
We cannot.
You are unharmed?
Completely.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
You killed him.
I haven't broken any laws.
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
Is this a trick?
Such the flirt.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
I <u>told</u> you.
Baby crocs?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
Good.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
No thanks.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
We might as well pack.
He's mooing.
Well...
Now I'm gonna puke.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
Well.  At wakes.
Yes.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
I thought I saw...
Hey!!
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Hector thinks you like him.
You think Jack's handsome?
Are you alright?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
I had a great time last night. Again.
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
The somebody else part?
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Sorry?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<u>You</u>?
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Lecter said a lot of things.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
You're all right! Where is he?
Get me out!
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Yes.
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
Then please - do this test for me.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
By the book, he's a sadist.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
How long did you live there?
Two months.
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Well that is to be expected. My father...
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
And my compliments to you...
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
I see...
Ottawa!
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
What a place for them...
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Wampum?
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Their arms?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
They found this?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Where the hell've you been?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
How do you know it was Williams?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
I'm going inside.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Do it.
It...almost got you.
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
I'll kill him!
A what?
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
Well?
What's that?
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
What are you doing?
Just carrying a bag.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Er well, yes we do.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
You what? What are you on about?
What do you mean?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
I want your bar.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Look. Go on, look.
What have you come as?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Six.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
No, sir--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
The--the officers.
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
I mean, follow orders, sir.
I do, sir.
Why don't you start with that?
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves--
You're testing me?
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Colt Peacemaker.
A .45--
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
Hey, it's the General.
If it's too late--
I'm a colonel.
They fought against the Indians?
They were in the Army. Like your father.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Well--
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Something like that.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Mikey--
Mikey look at this--
Yeah?
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
So where does that put us?
You could take it--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
That ring--
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Why would you want to do that?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
This girl is a friend of yours?
We have a daughter.
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Right.
I haven't been out here for a while.
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
There was a mandate in the last election--
How 'bout the Sheriff?
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
A little older than Paloma is now.
That's me.
He squeezed money out of you?
Okay? He's not here?
I don't think you can take it personally--
And when my father was Sheriff?
Yeah?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Something wrong?
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
You've got your mother, your kids--
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
How long have you lived here?
Couple months before I was born--
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
You think we need a new jail?
You don't need to cuff me.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
You sell much out here?
So when did Buddy leave?
No--
Yeah?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
You ever been married?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
How'd you spell that again?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
What's the connection?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
You don't believe me.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
So why did you marry him?
What did you find?
He taught all this to Swann?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Are you all right?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
Harry-?
And this Butterfield guy--
I heard he was the best.
What are you, my mother?
We've never met.
Whose is the car?
Maybe I just bought it.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Him too.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Yeah.  You could say that.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
I did it for Dorothea.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Is that all?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
Yes?
I don't know.
No.
What about Philip Swann?
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Yes.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Try twenty-five.
Hi again, how's it going?
Not really. How long are you here for?
I'm here for the week.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I don't remember.
You're possessive.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
I know.
You think so?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
What do you want to drink?
I'm sorry.
Mr. Harris?
Hello, darling.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Ok, well... I love you.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Ok.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
No, what are you talking about.
I don't know what to do.
Oh, the record company sent these...
I missed you.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I can't believe Will killed him.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
What're these?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Yes.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
Why are you doing this to me?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
Father, I'm right here.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Well I know he's come here before.
Trick him.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Yes, I know.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Peter, let go of the chair!
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
I know who he is.
Maya?  What do you mean?
What's this?
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
What's up?
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Ah, Mom.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I can't eat before a game.
Yeah, you met her?
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
She's alright.
Coach...
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
Sorry.
Hello.
What?
I don't know sometimes.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
And he's fine, girl.
I told him you looked like me.
You ever been in love?
Hey, munchkin.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
You were trying to make me look bad.
But?
Thanks.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Just not my type, I guess.
I just can.
Your Dad play?
He works at a bank.
I don't care.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
I know this.  What do you want?
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
That's it, give it your best shot.
Guess not.
What?
Give me the ball.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
You're not stupid.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Least you got your priorities straight.
You don't think so?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
You're serious.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Something was just missing.
you woke me up to tell me that?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
Then why are you so upset?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
We should head over.
Okay.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
You work too hard, Pop.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Lucky kid.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well what's the situation?
My mother had breast cancer.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
Your mother wants to hear from you --
What?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
You just move in here?
-- do you wanna cup?
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
You take cream or sugar?
yeah, good, ok.
You wanna go on a date with me?
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Just say no.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Ready to go,go,go?
Sure, why?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
I'm almost done.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
This sounds threatening.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
Mmm.Hmm.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
What is that?
She loves you.
Go fuck myself?
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
Is that still lingering?
In aid of what?
Not really.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
And your father?
I wouldn'tve asked --
Do you have your masters?
They wouldn't?
He's in here.
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
I AM CALM.
I live alone.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
I don't know a loud crash.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
No.
You on any medication?
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
All your other fluzzies?
What happend to you?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Willa Cather.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
Did you tell her?
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
Love you too..
Yes.
Rose, I don't --
No.
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
Did you ever touch her?
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Do you still have to do homework?
Was it a call back?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
818-753-0088.
Ok.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
I need this one.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
Hi.
Hi.
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Hang himself?!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
But --
So what has changed?
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
We go someplace dangerous.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
The King killed my son!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
Recent hours have been a shock.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Exactly why it should be given away.
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
You mean shut your ass down!
We're by Ozone...
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Did you hit him?
I'll take the south end -
Alright, where is she?
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
And what did he do to the girl?
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Yeah?
Where up north?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
No.  A witness.
I had it all on tape...
What happened with the tape?
Yeah.
No -
Oh man...what happened?
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
Both at the same bank...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
You must be going somewhere.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
What?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
Is it weird?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Who is it?
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
When are you coming back?
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There has to be.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
I'll cover the back.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
In eight days.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Do you feel privileged?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Do you have it?
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
It's Will Graham...
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
He's misunderstood.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
I call him a monster.
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Tell me about yourself.
To do what?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
No.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
You going back down to Florida after?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Are you George Sherman?
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I haven't decided yet.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I don't believe in God.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Tank you veddy much.
Those are my terms.
Andy!
How long would they let me sleep?
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
Andy!
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Hi...
Popcorn?
Have you told your family?
Sir, do you have a problem?
Are you at peace with your family?
Excuse me, Andy...
"Burlesque"?
We had a deal!!
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Then the informant is real.
Hurry!
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
Hello, Trinity.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
How long?
This isn't real?
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
Of the Resistance.
And she's never wrong.
Morpheus, I don't know --
How is he?
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
Hello, Neo.
Gee-zus.
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
But an Oracle can.
What are you doing?
I'm going in after him.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
No, you're not.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Tank, you're hurt.
They've burned through the outer shields.
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Riverdale.
'And with your spirit.'
Jewish...
Panther!  Same thing...
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Don't come any closer!!!
Keep your mouth shut.
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Chinese food?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
Nothing.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
Anything specific?
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Sal!... fourteen street.
I know...I know.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
You ate?
Daddy!
From the Korean War.
Who's Annie?
Honey, please.
Paillarde of veal.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
I didn't say.
Thank you.
Who are we talking about?
Perhaps you could remind me.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
It's going to be great --
What do you mean?
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Why?
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
I don't care.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
Make it go 'way.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
No.  Nothing.
Yes?
Oh yes, I do.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Yes...
How long have you been standing there?
More than you love peanut butter?
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
We know all that we need to know --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
No.
I won't.
How long have I got?
And what?
Bill --
Yes?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Joe --?
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Are you going to eat your lunch
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
That's okay.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I couldn't sleep.
Thanks.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
So that's what love is?
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't like what you're saying.
Okay.
I am not a dream.
You want me to be your guide --?
I do?  How long will you be staying?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
I'm sorry, I --
I think you know --
Where are you?
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
I'm sorry --
How's that, Quince?
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
We're all here, Bill --
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
What were you going to say?
So what's wrong with that?
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Then what is it?
I don't know, I can't say --
I love him.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
You and 'Honey'?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
...We know so little about each other.
21.
79.
You don't know?
Condition?
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Why?
Take the money and walk away!
You don't remember me.
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Yes.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
I wasn't helping you for money.
They treating you alright?
His name was Jimmy.
Calls himself Dodd.
They're not looking for him.
On the house.
How do you know about me?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
How can you read that again?
You've read it a hundred times.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Who?
Why?
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Like what?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
You probably.							 *
No. You took them out.						  *
Your name's Teddy.
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
What do you think?
It's a rip and a hit.
Tell them what you want.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
My end?
What's "nothing"?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
How's he not your husband?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Do I need it?
Would you find me...?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Alonzo...
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Then it don't work.
How much we looking for?
Havana, Cuba...?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
What is going on...?!
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
I am asking.  You to me.
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Yeah.
Define small.
So lay it out, my brother...
The Statue of Liberty.
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You sure you heard what I said?
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Don't say nothing about you either.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
They gotta be.
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Here. Don't even thank me.
Get outta my way.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Ready for anything.
You really want to do business?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
You got that, shit face? Asina...
Who?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Where you staying, Dad?
Where are the minefields?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Stupid.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Where is it?
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
What?
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Lawyers?
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Weird shit...?
You feel anything?
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Can we get this car there?
But the power...
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Gross. What is it?
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
What do you want to know?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Nothing.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
Well, I hope you like it.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
No big deal.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
See, isn't this nice?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Misery's Return?
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
I'm telling you, I can't.
What about a bee...?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
Why would you lose me?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
I'm almost done.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
You won.
I suppose I did.
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Feel like pleading for your life?
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Fight a bit of a cold..
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I knew where it was.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
More like two-two point two million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Before we kill her or cure her..
And the check's in the mall.
How're we doin', then?
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
- this is very disconerting..
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Awfully short notice..
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
You don't trust me.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Are you okay?
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
Like?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
And then what?
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
I don't.  No exactly.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
So what did he say?
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
You knew about Jim?
Dont Jim.
Talking's good, walking's better.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
This is Kittridge.
Go ahead.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Yes.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
Yeah.  I follow you.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
Information.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
About what?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Why?
Abort.  Thats an order.
- and picked us up in the States -
Whats going to make him do that?
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Connection denied.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Mona?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
You haven't once said you like my dress.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Yes!
Maybe I should come back another time.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
You don't have to help me.
Loretta.
Why what?
How many men since then?
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Son of a bitch!
Where are you taking me?
To the bed.
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
You don't get along with anybody!
It's the best thing there is.
No thanks.
It's really cold.
I'm afraid of who I am.
Let me go home.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Have Something.
Will you marry me?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
No.
No.
Hi.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
A wife knows.
What the hell happened to you?
Everything's different.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Don't fight.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Do you have a girlfriend?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
Will you join me for dinner?
That woman was a student of yours?
Yes.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Then why are you eating alone?
Why do men chase women?
I think it's because they fear death.
May I walk with you a ways?
Temperature's dropping.
People home.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
You mean the whole house?
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Oh.
What would he be doing down there?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What is that?
You said it again!
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Nu!
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Je...sus Christ!
I'm thirty-seven.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Exactly.  So... logically ...
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
To find the Holy Grail.
What is the capital of Assyria?
Bring out your dead!
Why?
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I think I could pull through, sir.
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
I don't want land.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Yes?
If we ... er ... 
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Why?
Well ... yes ...
They're all saying the word ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
Brave, Sir Rob ...
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
So?
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
How about yourself?
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
You know what I mean.
The good-looking one.
I'm getting dressed.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll be worried about me.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
You watch your tongue.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I wish to see my mother.
Whom you address.
What do you know about the Highlands?
I am a blank sheet.
Occasionally.
Why?
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
In time, she will.
John?
Yes, ma'am?
Yes?
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Then why send me back to them?!
Is that not enough?
Well, both.
Who?
Mrs Brown.
Erysipelas.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
I'm sorry, ma'am?
We were expecting you to return by six.
Why not?
From whom?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Ma'am?
Then why are you not with him?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Now what seems to be the problem?
I'm in the middle of it...
Happy?
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
It turned itself back on, Nick.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Virgin sacrifices?
No I'm not...
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
The clock's already ticking.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Our time's up.
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
It's here!!!
Of course I am.
Give her a chance, will you?
They fired everyone.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
It's been a very strange day.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
One.
It will work out.
... What??
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
I...
I told ya.
Wow!
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Right. See ya.
Very pleased to meet you.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean?
"You're still here?"
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
Yes, Sir.
I had a dream about this place.
Yeah, they showed me
Nice wallets.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
What's going on ?
Why should we trust you ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
What's the trick here ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
I wanted to let his family know....
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
This is cute.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
I thought you made this place ?
Don't.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
So ?
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
What was that ?
Look ! Look !
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Are you okay ?
Not now, Mom.
What ?
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Yeah.
She just had a baby that's all.
We have a baby?
Can I see him?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
And she saved it.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well...
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
But I wanna write about her.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Don't wake up Vada.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
What difference does it make?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Care for a smoke?
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Uh oh...
You mean,  this ring?
Right.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Wow!
No problem.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Then you'll be all set.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
So what's wrong?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Well maybe for you.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
What do you mean?
Hey! Oh look.
Did it hurt a lot?
Do you know him?
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
I need the job.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Does it make it easier to win?
I ahh, better go.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
When?
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Hi.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Oh, Vada...
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
We'd love to hear it.
Hi.
No.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Where's your bike?
Is that your Dad?
Who's that with your Dad?
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Got it!
Run faster they're after us!!
I do, she's real funny.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
It is not.
Say something it's too quiet.
I should look different.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
You have a real philosophy of life.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
The man you love.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Excuse me?
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Jesus, we're trapped!
... look good on Kimberly.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Please come, please.
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Hate that.
Endearingly absent-minded.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Thank God you were here.
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
And to m...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
You got a real good memory, Star.
What?
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
You going today?
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
She's going to rest now.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
He's going to run for president.
Third party?
What does he want?
Where are you going?
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Can I help you?
She sure sings nice.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
I feel really good.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
When I was little, in church.
Well, can you tell me why?
Who is this?
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Oh.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Why?
No, we never did that
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
You think it will?
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
What kind of pies do you have?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Are we in a big hurry?
Divine intervention.
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Thank you, sir.
Who isn't?
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
She was born without a tongue.
You guys stay on your bellies.
How is it?
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Not to anybody. She sings.
All right, Mickey.
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Yeah, we have a van.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Who?
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
How so?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Could we go with you and film it?
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Who's going to buy me a beer?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
You think so, Frankie?
Want to talk to you.
I said: Cut it out!
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Where's he at?
Thanks.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
You working?
You almost got into trouble back there.
No, on the porch.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
What d'you mean?
Just for the day?
Thank you.
What happened, Duff?
What about that girl?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
What about him?
Is that so?
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Uh-huh. Why?
My kids want me to teach them.
I don't want to hurt you.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What's on your mind?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
What did you say, boy?!
I said, she's in great shape.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Oh yeah?
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
I'll talk to the Mayor.
He's your son.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Take this off.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
What's an A.I.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Never heard of him.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
What?
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
I thought you already left.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
I think you're full of shit.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
How soon is soon enough?
What the fuck... are you serious?
I'm going in.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Won't that mean you're dead?
...Feels like you.
I'll be okay.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
What?
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
What?
Oh, man! Who told?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
You don't think I can do it.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
That is lingerie.
Wings?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
Have you been there?
Have you been to any parties?
Gus?
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
God, I can't do this.
It's just for a couple of months.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Yes.
That is so sad --
Into our group.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Aloha! Welcome!
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
We followed your instructions.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
If you went away, what would become of me?
It's not the gas, Dad!
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Come back here!
What about it?
What the hell are you talking about?
You remember your dreams, Grady?
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
Are you okay.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
What is it?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Okay, I guess.
Yor dad picking the music again?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Good morning, Jennifer.
You like gymnastics?
What?
What are these, beauty marks?
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
You need me, I'll be here all night.
You got five minutes.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Tell me about the kids.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
I'm serious.
To who?
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Remember -- open mind.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
What?
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
My God.
Freddy.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
That's enough, Kincaid.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Films mainly.
Coffee?
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
If that's all right.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Oh please sod off.
Okay.
You and every person in this country.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
That's spectacularly unfair.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Hello.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
What does it say?
No.  Not true...
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Do you want to stay?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
By the way -- it's you.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Mr. Thacker?
Well, fire away.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
No, no.  She doesn't.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Cool, huh?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Hey.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Why not?
What's going on?
No, Miss Ratched...
Yes, that is correct.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
Will you come with me, please.
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
You men remain seated!
Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
H-H-Hearts.
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
That's okay, kid...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Say... God Bless America!
No.
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
In there.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
What for?
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
Yeah, Mack?
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
What?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Giving up?
He can't hear you!
No!
Hit me.
Yeah, Mac?
I saw thum! I saw thum!
I wanna see it...
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Is that so?
Oh, what was that?
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
'Kay, Mac!
Are you a doctor?
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
How much ya wanna bet?
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Oh yeah...
Tha's your problem.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Your grandmother?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
A very large pig.
You...
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Why are you asking me this?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Why?
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Hi, Peter.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
What?...
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Hi.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
There's no such thing.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
I can't believe you did that!
Really?...
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
I was hoping for the real thing.
Well, to-- new friends.
So what do you think?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
No.  He smokes.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
What about your job?
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
You okay?
Now what do we do?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Faith--
And then what, Faith?
That was really sweet...
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Hi.  Where've you been?
...and a fortune teller.
Who said I was going?
No.  No, you go ahead.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Maybe I can change him.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Oh.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Huh?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
I wish I knew.
Working hard?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
See! You don't understand!
Why Edie, I
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
You know how the Sisters are.
What's that?
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
Want to go out and have one with me?
In a saloon?
How about another one?
Were you really a prize fighter?
Now what are you doing?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
I just told the Father.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Every one of 'em... .
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Someone else c'n take your confession.
What are you going to do?
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
What about it?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Looking for me?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Listen, Johnny
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Leave her alone, you fiend!
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
What can we do against them?
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
When!?
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
You know better than that.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
He didn't want me to.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
Forty-five minutes.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
I get that feeling, yeah.
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Come <i>on</i>.
What?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
What do you want to bet?
You excited?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
How are you, Raymond?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Karen, I told you not to--
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Who's sitting here?
Not until recently.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Boy, it stunk in there.
How many was that?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
You don't seem all that scared.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Nothing.
You know who this is?
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
I can go to the bar.
I don't have a problem with it.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
So.  What's your point?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
The flight?
Meaning?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Gee, I wonder why not.
Really?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Me?
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
Hi, Ray.
How you know that?
What's wrong with you?
I'm looking for Maurice.
Here?  In this house?
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
You were talking in your sleep.
He doesn't even look like that.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
We have a problem here?
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
I think he must've fell in.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
What lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Good shooting, Danny!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Waitress!  Four beers!
Where are we going?
What's there?
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
I heard what you did.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Our doctor's gone too.
We're all going away.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
The only one?
I don't get it.
All right. What's the scoop?
That's disgusting!
We're here on the sofa bed...
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I call this the staccato. 
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Maybe I blocked it out.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Where did you get that sweater?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
What do you know about classical music?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
But what has to be different?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Yes, sir.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Thank God for that.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
How do you feel?
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Isn't that awfully forward?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
I'm just happy to see you.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
What's the matter?
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
What happened to you?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
All set?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
I'm not burying him here...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
What do you mean?
You ever think about running away?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
What was the file name?
Aren't you giving an exam?
Don't apologize for me.
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Jerk... What did you say?
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Maybe you should think about it.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
About my blood work?
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
What's her name?
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
What happens?
We proceed, representing your estate.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Mom?
Is that a question?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
A homosexual encounter.
Get real.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
How many do you know?
Duh...
Since when?
Yeah... ?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Right.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
How did you do that?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Jesus.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Don't do this to me....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Like what?
Let's just be sure.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
How much you weigh, Johns?
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Fry?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Hasan?
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
I'd rather piss glass.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
So much for your nightfall.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
No.
What's so special about him?
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
How did it go?
Objection!
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
What signal?
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
But I'm not prepared to die.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
One is in a museum!
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
What about me?
I don't know.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Taylor! Tell him.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
But the proof? The doll?
...but 'Lias is still out there.
I SHIT on all o' you.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Come on man!
I'll go with you.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
What we got here a crusader?
What are you talking about! 
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
I don't know.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

Not tonight.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Dance?
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
How did you meet him?
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Nothing matters.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
In a way.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
Beer?  Well, all right.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
FLorida?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Private eye?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
Round of golf Saturday?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
It was lying where on the balcony?
In case you want to have us followed.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What are you doing here?
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
You get it's brother.
I think so.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
What about me?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Did you ever have a serious operation?
And if you didn't believe me?
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
What's this?
Of course.
How about your new friend?
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
Me too.
You don't trust me.
I think she liked me.
I haven't really thought about it.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Bastard.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Hello.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Now listen...
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
We'll see what we can do.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Thanks for stepping in.
What's this?
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
But you're not alone.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Wild ride, huh?
I'm not FBI anymore.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
They took a left at the next light!
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Who's the girl?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
I... I gotta go.
Well, I saw you and--
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Mean anything to you?
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
You saw what?
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Mmmnnn...?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Hawkins?
Where the hell is his body?
He knows our defenses.
Georgia.
No.
Congratulations, sir.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
No, you look like a hooker.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
For the whole night?
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Why?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
It's a very good year.
Why?
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Mmm, I could tell.
No?  Why's that?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Four thousand.
But you want days too.
I got a dress, yeah.
Any good?
Hello?
And that's the way the game is played.
You're upset, huh?
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Edward, I can't.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
I've never treated you like a whore.
Business.
It was good.
My what?
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Love this car!  Is it new?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
But, Edward...
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I'm up.
Why?
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Looks slow tonight.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Go for the bucks.
Want a pair of boots?
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Rent.  You're late.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
But I always eat like this.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Having a good time, Vivian?
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
My Westley will always come for me.
He will come for me.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
It never happened.
Why is that, do you think?
Faster!
-- Fezzik, please --
I have a little.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
You've been mostly dead all day.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Do you want me to go on with this?
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
What? What?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
Shall we track them both?
Could this be a trap?
Yes.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Now?
-- yes --
Sixty-five.
Are you a rotten liar.
Humiliations galore!
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
I must know.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
I accept.
You feeling any better?
What?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"I want to croon,
Oooooooops!
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Here, don't panic.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
What kind now, Leo?
Maybe you're happy.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
What is she gonna do here?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Max, I...
Yes.  We would!
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Do it!  Do it!
Do you need us?
Min Bialystock.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
I solemnly swear...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
The Graf Spee...
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
Of which morning?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Yes.
A lot?
Like what?
Did he say anything about my sister?
May I talk to you?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
You've led a charmed life.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Sam! Why call when we can go?
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Does that mean we can't...
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
What is it?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Sam! No!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Why don't you go away?
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Crane.
You slept here all night?
No, m'am.
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
I don't know what you've been saying.
Shut up!
...Forty thousand dollars!
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Did I?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Did she talk?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
You--a friend to me?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Well, news of Buckley?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
What's that?
The wound is bleeding!
Yes!
Your father?
The child!
Yes.
What are you laughing at?
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't agree with you.
Well, I do say it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'd call it stupid at any time.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
But I think these things are beautiful.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Are you giving me this straight?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
I used to be married to one.
No kiddin'?
Almost certain.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
What do you mean police dog?
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
You weren't going with her?
Who'd steal her body?
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
You go in for dangerous things.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
What is it? What happened?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Could you?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
I've been dreaming about this.
Yes?
I know, Mother.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
He did?
You won't die, Rose.
Five hundred rabbits?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Well... maybe...
Daddy, what's the matter?
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
There goes Mother.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
So am I.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Of course.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Honey!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Is anything wrong?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Yes, sir.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
I see. Outside it.
Um-m, well...
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
Afraid of the hospital?
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
You can stop it right now.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I can work this.
Where you gonna be?
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Happy Independence Day.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
It doesn't say that.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
Well, sir...
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
You know what I mean.
You think this is so easy?
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
How'd we do?
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
The gang's all here!
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Luke!
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Hey!
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
He's my father.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
There is no conflict.
Told you, did he?
Yes or no will do.
You promise you won't tell?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Janet.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
We must have a blow-out.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Weiss.
No, don't do that.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Good God.
You're OK by me.
What a guy
From Transexual Transylvania.
Was all I had to say
Feeling
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
It doesn't bother me either.
Yes, I do.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's fine.
I don't think I belong here.
No, I don't belong here.
...What?
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
...What?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
No doctor!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
...Stop jivin'!
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Fouls.
...Still don't feel no heat.
How was the flight, Champ?
I don't like ya face.
Kiss my ass.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Cost ya a buck.
That's ten bucks.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
What's happenin' here?
Ya still light seventy.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Makes your breath like garbage.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Come July, twenty-five.
The legs must be goin'.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
...What?
Ya got heart.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
...The guy's great.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Fine... That guy's great.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
How I look out there, Mick?
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Paulie.
What?
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
I'm thirty myself.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
I'll do okay.
How ya feelin'?
What?
What gaps?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Shoulda guessed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Check the scrawl.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
What's that comin' from the bar?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
They?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe.  Why?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Wrong number?
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Two bits.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Good-morrow, cousin.
But new struck cuz.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Good heart, at what?
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
My poverty, but not my will consents.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
I come for my lady Juliet.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
[Within] Juliet!
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Ay me!
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
What wouldst thou have with me?
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
What is?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Do you have it?
That's it.
Then I guess we're set.
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Yeah.
So this is what, a test?
You seem one to me.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
You should watch what you eat.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
I ride with fat-boy...
Eat shit and die slowly...
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Same thing, isn't it?
What's the difference?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
How did you know?
What's going on?
I've seen a lot of people die before.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Dark ops?
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
They don't have the package.
So I do it.
Time to quit.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Because I don't walk away.
You son-of-a-bitch...
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
Gaelic.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Dwayne listen to me -
Ready to roll, partner?
Never heard of it.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We don't know that.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
You said that last time!
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
It's gonna be o.k.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
That's right.
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
What are you talking about?
Well, I don't know...
How are ya?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
You mean that guy was an agent?
What's wrong?
Great...
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
A satellite dish?
I don't know.  My friends...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
A week ago, at most.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Lingerie...
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Uh...C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Why?
What?
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Dwayne put the gun down --
What?
I'm not asking.
Oh Jesus Christ...
I was in the neighborhood.
Don't you want it?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
No, I just assumed...
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
How much is that?
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
El Capitan?
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
No.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
What'd I say?
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Hello.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
It's my job!
Who died?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
It sounds impossible --
Who?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
Gimme the binoculars.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
What is it?
Are you okay?
Why did you help me?
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Fine.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Let's go.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
What?!?!
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
This money is evidence.
New York City?
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Baby Duck?
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
What is your name?
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
I know, but --
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
You have one of these?
No.
-- what the hell is that?
Shortcut?
The license!  You get it?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Don't go there...
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Yes, I know this song.
Oh my god. Griffin.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
You don't like it?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
I'm talking about the girl.
What kind of assignment is that?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I still have work to do here.
Really?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Unbelievable, she got to you.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Originality is my speciality.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Twice...
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Six-fifty.
I think so.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Yes.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
I'm listening.
Reporter?
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
It's probably because you got him fired.
I'm going to kill myself.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Lighten up, what?
What happened at the luau?
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
But it's on the water.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Nope.
It's delicious, trust me.
That doesn't make any sense.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
And then I'll see you in New York --
About forever.
Walter.
So what happened?
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Right.
What?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
How amazing.
What?
Sure you do.
Which means --
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
I don't think I could really describe it.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
No.
Window.
Dad?  About last night?
It plays in 50 states.
Does red pepper go under R or P?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
I know.
What was?
Bye bye blackbird.
I'm starting to forget her.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Don't ever do that again.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
What if I couldn't get to you?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Do you like it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
You're kidding --
Is he there?
I read an article about this ...
Whose side are you on anyway?
Well?
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
They are singing for me.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Forget it.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
What were they saying? About you? In there?
They say I am no good to you.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
How do you feel?
I waited up till midnight.
Where are you going?
When?
No.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Where's your mama?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Bobby?
What?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
What is it?
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Nothing.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Then leave.
Why not?
Fuck you.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Oh. Hi.
What do you want from me, Colette?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Ass first into the world.
What's wrong, Danny?
They would have killed you too.
What is it?
Why?
How you holding up?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
You're going to have to explain that one.
You want a hit?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Danny?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
Shoot him.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Danny, I'm touched.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Question is, what are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Jesus.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
When is the deal going down?
Nervous?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
And you've got wiener breath.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Don't worry about it.
Find a chaplain.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Casualties?
So, where are you from?
That must be four thousand yards.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
Watching.
A half-track, anything.
How about that jeep?
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
It seemed appropriate.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
You get a translator, Captain?
Nope.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
What do you think?
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Huh?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Yes, Private.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
For going to school?
I'll take the whole set.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
But you never had a first date.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Hang in there, man.
Did you sleep with her?
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Lloyd?
Honey, about what?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Are you busy on Friday?
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Keymaster?
So it's an honor?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
That's cool then.
No, I'm serious.
I think you should wear that.
Me?  Sure I do.
What did you say?
It's okay, everybody does that.
No.
This is so noble.
It did?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Okay, what did we just decide?
We decided...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
You shared it with a dick.
Did you talk to Corey?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Then don't do it.
How's it going?
You're freaking out here man.
YEAH!
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Very talented.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Just her name.
I called her up.
Now you're back.
What's your name?
What's that?
This is not my problem.
I need a drink.
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
And killing.
I'll talk to him.
I heard a noise.
That's too bad.
Hello? Ted?
Cotton.
You could start with an apology.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
Its over, Cotton.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Where's Sid?
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
I never meant to imply...
You broke my heart.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Time to change numbers again?
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
That was good.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
Easy black boy.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
What's your favorite scary movie?
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Shush.
I get scared really easy, okay.
Do I?
What do you mean?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
What?!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Jesus Gale what happened?
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Did you request this case?
To me Hollywood is about death.
What did you know about your mother?
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
How is that good news?
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Is that a threat, Detective?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
What?
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Yeah?
They've got her!
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
You used to say that was our strength.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
What?
Thank you.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Possibly.
Basements creep me out.
Nobody said she was an actor.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
You're dead!
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Yes, sir.
Oh it did?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
NO! Don't believe him.
Why did you kill my mother?
Hello?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Who are you trying to reach?
To apologize.
Uh-huh.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
To talk.
Michael... Michael Myers.
But you're doing so well.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
He's not a suspect, is he?
So is Dewey your real name?
Sidney's father?
Does mom know?
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
Should I be worried?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
I was first to respond.
She staying with you?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
You think he could still be in town?
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
So where are you?
Hello?
I heard screaming.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Why are they doing this?
Why are you doing this?
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
You know that's not true.
Not here.
It could be nothing.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
Did you read them?
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
It is Victor.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
We don't know for sure...
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Well, that was money well spent.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
We're focusing.
What are you talking about?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
You knew I'd say yes.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
How's California?
It was, I tell you!
You ain't goin'...
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
Got a warrant?
He cometh forth like a...
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
That don't make 'em kin...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
What?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Lemme alone...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Comancheros...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I got your boy killed.
Why it's just a snip of calico...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
She'd be about thirteen now...
But couldn't you...?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
It still worked in town.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
What are you doing?
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Ellen.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
And that is?
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Tenth floor.
Oh
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
We will all be put in the clink.
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Romeo
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
And your relations?
Will it restore my gift?
Yes, I saw it.
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
That's me.
Very well.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
it will be all right, madam.
Do you know it?
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
Who is she this time?!
What piece? Richard Crookback?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
What? Who?
Romeo.
How will it?
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
And--?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Master Shakespeare
But the plague
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
I am.
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh--no, no!
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
He is dead?
Yes, sir.
And break her heart and mine?
"Poet?"
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
No.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Is this necessary?
That was good.
How much did you pay?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Who?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Where do you think you'll go?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
This is just an informal discussion.
What?
That's it, then.
Yes, thanks.
I thought you stopped going.
Well, she had problems --
I think you're lying.
Have you seen Hugo?
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So?
Open it.
I wonder how he did it?
What are you doing?
What?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
It's about me and David.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
We already know. All about it.
So let's go.
What?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Hello.
What do you do?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
The human condition.
That sounds fine.
Chicken salad.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Then what's the problem?
Maybe... why do you ask?
Yes, but... I thought...
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
I just thought you'd like to know --
What're you looking for?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
What about?
I hope she's all right.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
She's a friend of Jill's.
Oh, no.
I guess so.
Yeah.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Yeah, it is.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
Right now?
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Great.
I went to school with her husband.
You do know what money's like these days.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Yeah.
Whew.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Hey, I don't tell.
No! Don't! Please!
-- what guy?
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Don't do it.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
What are you looking at?
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Me?
-- yes, you --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
It's too late...
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
What for?
What?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- why did you come in today?
Not yet.
There were some shots.
Where?
George, I don't --
How are you, baby?
You're great.
I am?
We live together now.
Yeah.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Yeah, baby...
Go where?
Okay.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
A friend dropped me off.
Never mind. Where've you been?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Yes.
Obviously.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
No?
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
You're right.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Sorry, honey, I...
I know it, I know it.
Isn't that bad for it?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Did they have something against me?
No thanks.
Me!
You really think so?
A soap?
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
I'd like a drink.
Why not?
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I know, I'm sorry.
Well, what is it, honey?
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
What?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Egypt?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.
What's wrong?
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
No, it's not that...
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
All right.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Mommy... Mommy...!
Talking to Tony.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
No charge?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Somebody did that to him.
Get him out of here?
Stop it!
Have any trouble finding us?
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
Well, obviously some people can be
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Lowe's car-?
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
You booger.
What's that?
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yeah? Really?
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Perhaps.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
But how?
Were you tempted?
But I'm fearful!
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
Yes?
Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
What is it, Mary?
What a shame!
Pay attention...
What?
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Wet behind the ears.
Three years.  A rookie.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
She won't?  Why not?
Bobs
Goddamn it!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
You mean black people?
What's a concubine?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
No food?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
In English?
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
But... wait a minute...
You sent for me?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Like what?
I just need a few more weeks,
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
What're you doing?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Hail, Mary.
We're looking for Mike.
But you didn't tell me!
Well?
It didn't work, Vince.
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
However, we can also pray for other things.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
We both missed.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
What are you spying on?
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Hmm?  See them?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Have they nothing to fear presently?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I manage fine alone.
Where are we going?
All I saw was their lantern.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
In test... what?
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
I insist that you have it.
People have put their trust in you.
And this gives worth to butchery?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
I apologize if I worried you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What was that?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Father saw you die.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
How are you, Bill?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
It's too big.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
It went real good.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
I ain't sure.
Sure, I guess.
You like that Vaughan?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
I want to be baptized.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
Why? Hi, Karl.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Who did you kill?
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
So it died when it come out?
A little ol' boy.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
No sir.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
You all right, Mama?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Do they know about you?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I reckon not.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Before they were married?
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Like me, too.
Will that be cash or charge?
And what about for you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And how much are these?
And these?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I think I'll take them. 
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
It was just a thought.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Yeah? Who is it?
Well?
Aren't you going to say anything?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
I owe you something.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Are you going to be all right?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Hi, kid.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Lettuce and tomato?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
How long you have this detail?
You're wondering why I held it.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
What for, Sheriff?
And what's that?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
What else could it be?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Not in those words.
Carl never lied.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Funny?  In what way?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Those two musicians from the garage!
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
With you.
As far away as possible.
You going to call the police?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Tore off one of my chests.
Down, Daphne!
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Security.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Hey - these are real diamonds.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Sugar?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
Did you hear that?
Are my seams straight?
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Stay as long as you'd like.
When?
Not you, Sugar.
I'll carry the instruments.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
No!
Thirty-four.
- you got to be blonde -
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Me too.  Bye now.
Who?
I don't care.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
What's the job?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Tell what?
Running away?  From what?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Rough?
You can't trust those guys.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Glasses?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Want to switch berths with me?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Why?
Your face is familiar.
For your own amusement?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
- opening of the Opera -
Why?
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Would you do me a favor?
Anything this time?
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Mineral baths - now really!
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Me?
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Daphne -
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Spats Colombo.
You know what I love about all this?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Hey.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Im sorry?
Hi. Hey.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
I dont know.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Oh, no.
Yes.
What?!
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
I should go.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Here it is, right here.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Can you swim?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
It was too dark, Daddy.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Well, looka here...
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
You hurt, Daddy!?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
That's right!
No mam -- I looked all over.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
I'll walk...
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Tired.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
There are more important matters right now...
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
My head hurts.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Suck my balls.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Come on, just get to the message board!
Mph rmpmh rm.
Mph rmph rm!!
Mph rm rmph!!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
You've got a stupid accent too.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
The N word?
You bastards.
Kyle?!
What's going on, Chef?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mrph?
MOM!!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Oh my God...
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
This is sweet!!
I thought you had something planned.
WHAT?
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
And Bill?
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
But I-
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Hey, relax guy!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
Did you see that, Wendy?
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Hi Wendy.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
You didn't?
What is it?
It can't be.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
You're certain of that?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Is that clear?
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
What are we going to do?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Yeah.  We did it.
Do you want some advice?
Oh my God.  What happened?
I'm not going with you.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
I'm in the bridge.
I'll do my best.
Will you marry me?
I'm fine.
No, just enjoying the view.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
What the hell is that?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You have orange whips?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
Theo.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
What the fuck is this?
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Uh...over easy.
I don't like to talk about it.
Knock-knock.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Someone wants to play with me?
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
You know who I am?
What if he wants to get out?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Yeah.
I'm a bowler.
Whips...orange whips.
The mental hospital.
No. Do You?
Do I want you?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
What are you going to do about your brother?
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
I can't tell you, Theo.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
I feel sick.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Increase positive pressure!
Don't do it!
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
It's impossible.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Well, where the fuck is he?
How much damage?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Underwater?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
We have a library?
Yeah, why?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Beth --
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Four days?
What's the matter?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
That wasn't in there before.
You don't believe me.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Parasolutrine?
What's that?
It's like a sleeping pill?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
How fast does it take effect?
I'm sorry.
Your watch.
You think I'd really drink that?
How do you feel about snakes?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
You manifested that, Beth.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Hear what?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
No.  I don't think so.
I don't get it.
Then what is it?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Just in time, too.
Why are you looking at me like that?
When did it come across?
How are you feeling, Norman?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Am I?
You remember opening the door?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
You don't remember that?
Norman, where are you?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
That's right.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Did I kill her?
Push her, c'mon.
There is one possibility.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Well, if it's a discharge --
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Captain who?
What report?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Four.  Four years --
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I know that.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
What's wrong?  What's happening?
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
Have you been checked out?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Get to the ship!
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
I read you sir.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
What an honor...
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
I don't believe it !
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Or...?
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Who ?
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
I love you, Carmen.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
Should I be ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Which way ?
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
What ?
Guess you gotta go.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
Way to go, amigo !
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
...CUT OFF !
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Yes, sir...
<U>Why</U>...?!
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Granted.
It's taken control of the computer...!
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Was he difficult?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold station.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Viewer ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
Sure plan to.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I want to rent this one.
You haven't heard of it.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
I...
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
But why the dalmation?
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
Yes...
...who...?
What are you doing?  I love your script.
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
You like kids?
You can do it.
Gosh, you look nice.
That's something a man could do...?
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
What am I gonna do?
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
What are they offering?
That's so beautiful...
I've been thinking.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
Well, where do they hold court?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
Are you all right...?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Tell it with...
What I...
You can go...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
What's his name?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I wasn't in the car.
She's absolutely r...
Look.
But we...
Who is that...?
Yeah.
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
I...I...
...I can't do it, Wally...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
I know...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Main Street.
...he's the producer of the movie.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
He saw the girl in the car...
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
Why?
<u>Siddown</u>!
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
How do they know that, you told them?
No.
You didn't see it...
It's lovely.
If you do the product placement...
She wasn't in...you were al...
Wally...?
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
And we're glad to have you here...
...it is?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
That will never happen.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I could help with the debate.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
You touched it.
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Me too.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Still, please.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Machines do not EAT message.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
I'm sorry, I just...
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
You feeling all right?
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
She hasn't mentioned this.
Can I look at the pictures?
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
My advice to you?  Don't die.
Is that what he told you?
Aw.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Restless.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
You know...Stanley...
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Yes.
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
The camerawork's nice.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
Nothing, I guess
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
We're not ready.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Don't even joke about that!
It's all about who you know.
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Hi, Dad!
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Who is this?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
I do.
Great. How old are they?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
I said I'll lead.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
Well Cooper...
Are you going to kill us?
Well?
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
So, what are we looking at White?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
I say we head out.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Where is this...thing?
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Yes!
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
No, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
I don't think so, sir.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
And you'd like to see that?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Roger.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Yeah?
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Shoot, Lothar.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Second safety.
Recall what mistake?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
I don't get you, King.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Sure, King.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
What's it about?
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Yeah.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, no.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
I know, man.
You know?
Y- s-sure it did.
Guess not.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Am I fucking him?
Yes! Free concert!
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
It's okay.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Whoa!
Yeah!
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yes!
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
You rich?
He is.
A Porsche.
What about me? I don't have a car.
What was your name again?
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
That chick, Erica?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Jeff, stay there.
Jeff! Come up here!
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Your sure as hell right about that.
Of course I do!
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Jeff. Jeff.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
What?
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
You're unbelievable.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
Camel jockey.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Is that your driver?
Oh, yeah?
You do not!
You're not serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Yeah?
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Soon.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
You do?
Is that Jeff?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
I'm going out later.
Fuck.
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
You sure?
Positive.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
I know, but that was before.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
You're kidding.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Hannah, we've...
Is that you down there?
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Really...
Bank branch!
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
I didn't mean to --
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
I'll take it.
Hurt feelings department.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
As for instance?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
What teacher?
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
You did?
Into what? A lampshade?
I was afraid of that.
We're engaged.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Nice job.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Why not?
I just don't.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
Why did she call me?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
No.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
It is not.  Get out.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Fair enough.
Of course it is.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.

Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Where are my cigarettes?
Don't you want to come along, darling?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
That's a lie!  They still want me!
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
You heard him.  I'm a star!
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
Madame is waiting.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
How come?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Joseph C. Gillis?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Paramount studios.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
Is this Nigel's doing?
Who didn't?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
Hey! Ethan!
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
Oh no, not you again.
Why should I believe you?
Guess! Go on.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Hey, where you going?
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Oh, no thanks.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You see, a tree is a living thing.
Your hair looks the same.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Nigel, get lost.
You're wasting your breath.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
I knew it!
Why?
Don't stop. Keep moving.
What are you talkin' about?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You...um...you never got married?
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Uh-huh.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Gus?
Wipe 'em out?
Is this whitemail?
What will it do?
Watch out for them air pockets!
No, we're just going down.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Who is she?
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Uh. . .
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
I'm sorry.
What else could I do?
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
No possibility for parole?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I asked the right question.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
What shall we do now?
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Awesome!
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
What's he going to say?
What's that?
What was that about?
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
What I need this for?
You are . . .
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
It was hot, yes.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Mom...
Mother...
Not...gray.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
What now, my love?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Listen...thank you.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
What are you doing here?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Nuts. He made it.
What's the temperature now?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Meteorites!
We just take it?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
They stop for nothing.
You?! How about me?
No news is not good news. Y'know
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Twenty-four.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
He is. Usually.
Superman???
Well...flashlight?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Oh.
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Sure.
Do you like pink?
There.
What's the matter, Otis?
I broke the man out of prison --
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Maybe I should get help.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
She didn't.
What...does it turn to?
I'm...so sorry.
I...don't think so.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
My name is...
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Yeah.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
A while.
Yes.
Your kids never cry.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
Berries.
Berry-picking.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
Did his parents attend to that?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
What other people?
Anything you didn't understand?
That's what he said, is it?
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
Away from your crazy Mom.
You want a cup of tea or something?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
What happened to summer?
So do you like your new room?
Oh.
Should I keep reading?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
DADDY!!!
Yes.
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.
I tested positive.
Is there shrimp on it?
You can't come here.
No.
You remember that much?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Of course.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
It's okay.
Nothing.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
She'll move away.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Why, has he bothered you before?
Is it news to you?
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Can I come out?  No.
Can I come in for a minute?
I didn't say that, J.J.
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
Sidney, I told you -
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
- He's got them on him.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
If that's for me, tear it up!
Take a top coat.
That's no way to talk...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
We stick in each others craw.
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
I tried to reach you twice -
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Please... let... the kids... go...
Do you have bandages?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Everything.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
This is tactically dangerous.
Will it melt in there?
No shit?
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I know!
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
The CPU from the first terminator.
It's finally over.
Respect your elders and your betters!
Where you from, David?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Steve.
What's in those files?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I don't buy that.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Yeah?
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Like this bandleader.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Yes, Chuck?
I hate the beige one.
That's none of your business.
Freezing.
What's he like?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Kyle?
I want it to be over for you.
He'll find us, won't he?
A girl.  You know.
Sarah.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Call her.
Did you play recently?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
See you around.
Why not?
They'll love that.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
What is this!?
Who are "they?"
What did you say?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
... what... ?
It's mine...
I saw them kill him!
Studied acting, I assume?
No.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
You need anything?
Are you still on mediction?
I'm going to call.
It's them.  They did this.
Do you know how to change a tire?
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
What's all this for?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
And if nothing's lacking?
Physical?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Goodnight.  See you home.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
No.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
Luke, can I talk to you?
You could have.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Are you working with her?
It was very specific.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Oh!  You scared me.
Yes.
She was unhappy.
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Fifteen dollars.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Is it over?
Why?
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I've never had a pedicure before.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Is that a problem?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
It's not a compliment.
We think?
Hey.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
What kind?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
CQ what?
Eduardo.  Rama.
You're kiddin' me, right?
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Huh?
Has he?
You goin' back inside?
Steady on.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
You just cooking then?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Not her brand.
Been busy, have you.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
She never told Eddie, though.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
That's what was estimated.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
How do you know?
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
I miss my kids.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Is he here?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
And how do we share--
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I'll have it in a week.
Way out of line.
That'll be fine.
She's a rare one.
All right, I guess.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm.
...Dave?
Just coffee.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
So?
...What's so damn strange about that?
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
...OK.
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
...So, uh, who should I--
Yeah.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
...You ever wonder about it?
...How you today, Ed?
...Nah.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
'Lo, Ed.
Not an owner.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Someone broke into this room.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Yes.
I don't want to scare people.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Behind you.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
What doors?
What happened to them?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
The sub-basement?
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
What is it?
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Quiet!
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Oh no.  I smell it.
Mbwun.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
I don't know.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
I think... it means it's full.
For what?
You smell that?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
That's right.
You want to book the flight?
Why is he in the basement?
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
Who are you?
The memory of who?
That's right.  Lauren.
No.
Well, what do you want to do?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
You think so?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Who?
What're we doing here, Truman?
What exactly?
No.
Stay where you are!
How did it go today?
Oh, my God!
I won't be here Sunday.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
You got it.
--How do you know about that?
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Special Agent Scully --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Of what?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
And what's that?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Before the bomb went off?
Not according to the men in blue.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What?
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
I'm on the roof.
What's wrong, Scully?
Mulder...?
Scully, I found the bomb.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Why?
They were the ones that put us together.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
I wake you?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
What are you implying, Scully?
You said you weren't coming?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
You can't quit, Scully.
I need you on this, Scully --
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
About what?
And they want to blame us?
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
I have answers for you.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
You liked him?
Intravenous administration complete.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
You're looking well.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Give her some cigarettes.
Thank you.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
Yes.
...at all.
Can I hear you?
In German?
Oh, that was many years ago.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
I wish I knew.
I'm going back home.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Of course.
Nichts danke. Kein.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Do you see what that means?
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Well?...
I suppose you don't believe me.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
I said you win.
Be sensible, Martins.
...of Santa Fe."
I know a very good dentist.
Seems exciting.
What about?
Striptease, sir.
Listen...
Coffee.
You really liked it?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Not yet.
Vinkel.
Coming to the point, please.
Speak English?
Coffin?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Yes, it is.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He didn't want to get involved.
No.
Should I make it all fact?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
I'm Daffy.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Big?
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
What about Moliere?
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
We swim.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
You think?! Based on what?
What do you think you're doing?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
I don't, but...
How come you know all this shit?
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Which is what?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
So you're saying it's not true.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
A forty-five.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Which was his room?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Shut up. Fuck you....
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
How did you know they were Jews?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
Adam Sandler.
We tested the new bomb.
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Hello!
Where did you two meet?
What was he like, when he was little?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Jacques!  Johana!
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
How do you know that?
Ten thousand.
Roberto?  How long?
Enzo, wake up!
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
Why?
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Madame...
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
What is it?
That's good.
Tea... or whiskey?
In the lake?
Please, have a seat.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Hello?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
What?
Johana... New York.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
What do you want me to do?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
Get off of me you cripple!
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Sure, I like my leopards
I want him to lock me up.
What's left of him.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
Cut.
He will be waiting...
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
That's right, of course.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
Get it out of here!
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
That's easy. Me.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
I know. Funerals.
What! You can't be --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
Kiki?
I know -- Teresa -
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Thats right.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
Oh-oh! Touch, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Leon hung himself.
You splendid bastard...
Dont you believe in simplicity?
So you did talk about it, huh?
What do you suggest?
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Yeah.
Yes... Good, good...
Where are the kids?
Where is it?
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
No.
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
Oh... We split up.
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
What happens now?
Problems?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
What is?
At what time will you be available?
Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
Who else knows about the boy?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Los Angeles?
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
What about his girlfriend?
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Cinq cents.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Three...
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Now?
What did they say?
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
You make it sound so simple...
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
But it is what I want.
We must sound the retreat!
Do as I say!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Sound the retreat...
Go onto the next question.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Do you have a sword?
Scared of a girl?
Who are you?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
What were you doing when the voice came?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Yes...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
I'm... I'm not the king...
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
... You look wonderful...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
Does he have hair?
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
So... what is the message?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
And... what does Jeanne think?
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Jeanne... what are you doing?
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
Yes!
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
What for?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
He never says his name.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
I don't want to wait for his call.
Jeanne, be patient.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
And how's Yurek?
When's your baby due?
Let me see this.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Have you seen this?
Calm down, what, what is it?
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
They were taking you away.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Careful! Watch his hand.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
She looks tired.
On your property?
Yes, why not.
You don't want to learn.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
What on?
He's given it to us.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
All right if I look around your lobby?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
Naw, it's okay.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
I'm out, Johnny.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Which one?
What about the other one?
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
You sober?
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
Everything go all right?
He threatened to kill me.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
Then why you doin' it?
Yeh.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
See ya and raise three.
See and raise 1,000.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
She coulda killed me last night.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You doin' anything tonight?
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
You should always look to the back too, kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I'm in.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
What happened to your face?
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Why not?
Said he stole his invention.
Don't cry.
I can't.
Go!
You know, we know each other.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
I don't know.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
What would your mother say to that?
This is my wedding.
It's a promise?
You can take that out to the car.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Gilbert!
No.
You've been there?
No proof?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
I think we're on the right track.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Are you kidding?
I didn't know they had a fight.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
I think we may as well sit down.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I couldn't go near that woman.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Did you get my money?
What'll I do if something comes up?
Is Julia going with you?
But what if you need more money?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
How are you?
But he has nothing to do with it!
All right - you didn't.
What's that?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Isn't that my drink?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
Want a drink?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
I don't believe he did it.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
You dog!
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
I did find him!
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
What things made you so sure?
How long has he been dead?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Why are you saying it?
Yes.
Maybe she has.
I'm sorry...  but...
Baghdad.
What's it say?
For climbing.
What am I supposed to do?
You ready?
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
No.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Wh-what do you think--
They're not going to--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
It's a mine, isn't it?
I don't hear any--
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
We're not going to do anything.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Wait.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
Wes might be right about that.
We can't just leave him.
Makes two of us.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
No!
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do we do?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
When did you make the switch?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
We have to go back.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Maybe we should give him some water.
Drug evasion with....
I'm not hungry.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
They're watching us now.
no...no, no.
Who?  Who's leaving?
You're in violation.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
What was that....
That's not it.
Where are they?
How's the print coming?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
This is where the van was parked.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Whadaya mean?
Computer device?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
What was it this time?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Goddamit, Reilly--
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
No!
Eleven o'clock! 
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
Yes!
But--
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Just dull.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
I hope you find the figures correct.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Um-hum!
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Very well, m'sieu.
You say I am a crook.
Monescu.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
No, thank you.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
The fourteenth of May.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Seven and nine!
They're all right, aren't they?
Five, seven, and nine--
Spanish passports?
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doa Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Beautiful specimen.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Any minute I want!
But attractive--
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
I <u>believe</u> you.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Call the police?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
I know!
Yes, madame?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Yes, my bag!
Yes, I saw it--but--
The pumps --
The ship will sink.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
Holy shit.
Don't you mean work me?
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
An accident?!
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Something serious has happened.
But I was with him the whole time.
Sure. Count me in.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
The boats are all going.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
You're distracting me. Go away.
How cold?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
I'm Jack Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
A mistake?
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
I'll be right back.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
It's been 84 years...
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Hope we're not intruding.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
Where have you been hiding?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Yes?
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
But--
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Don't let's talk about it.
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
We coulda got two third-class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
No, sir?
Change?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Are you screwy?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Say--wait a minute!
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
I should say not.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
June? That's my wife's name.
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Oh, there you are--
McKinney's the name.
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
I don't get the humor of that remark.
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
Not because of Ned.
No!
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Thank you.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
I'm all right.
Nothin'.
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Excuse me?
That's the rumor.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Satisfied?
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
All right.  Then what?
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Colorado's closer
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
What can I get you?
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Oh, all right.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Florentino!  He's getting away!
What'd you do that for?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Get down, boy.
What about all these saloons?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
But -
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
How did you get this number?
I wonder if it runs in the family.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'd rather die alone.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
What - no lust for adventure?
Q! How are you?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
... Shoelaces?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Natalya?
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Interesting video tape.
... Kids?
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
- You're not.
What?
Blood or Dutch?
He's killed closer.
What now? And don't give me some movie clich like 'trust me.'
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
- I told you! He was there! -
He brought that up from the wreck.
Is the helicopter ready?
Fueled and waiting.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Maybe. Maybe not.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Who is it?
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
You all act like two roosters.
Hush.
Hush.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Just stay in bed and rest.
What did you put on it?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
You should go back and rest.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Those boys never did have good luck.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
What's a toby?
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
You can bring ONE toy...
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
What are you doing over there?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Can!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
I could have stopped him.
Right?  Buddy?
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Woody!  The rocket!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Are you peeking?
She's sick!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
A lunchbox?!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
It's Sid!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
But you're Irish!
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Reprieve.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
So did I.
Did you do this?
You're well built; how old are you?
I can't find Manolo.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Carl, that's insane.
Carl --
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Barbara --
Caroline --
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
How are your grades?
Yes, mom --
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Not Tiger Woods.
David --
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
So go shower already.
You first.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
What?
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
We agree.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Any way we can do it better?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
She's not at that place you sent her?
Did you tell him?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'll be right after you.
For fuck's sake.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
Following the game at all?
Good luck, Spud.
Nightmare.
You don't know, do you?
Say something, Mark, say something --
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Cut it out.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Why?
How much?
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Stick it on my tab.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Where did she come up with that?
Homeless people?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
The ship....
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Following new course. Warp seven.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
Captain?
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is it possible?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
The emergency channel, open.
...mark two.
What is this?
Spock?
What are you doing?
We must change our course at once.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Now learn something about yourself.
Your vision?
No special conditions?



Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
No. I will not.
I don't understand...
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
Senior exec.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
How's it going upstairs?
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
What for?
They'll start to soon enough.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Right on the money!
This town's full o' live ones.
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
If you think -
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
You wouldn't dare.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Dumont!
Where did you hear that name?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
You're alive!
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
What's goin' on?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
That's not true, honey--
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Okay, Dad.
Dad, how come you know the words?
You're kidding.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
What's this for?
Thanks dear.
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Station wagon?
It can't be.  Not Helen.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
She's still at my house.						*
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
So, it was your first time.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Yes what?
Hello, Harry.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
They must've just missed me.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
My husband can't know about this.
I think so.
Natasha?
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
What about Juno?
God, you have great legs.
And you've got one.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
You working on someone right now?
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
I understand.
Worse than Cairo?							*
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
You'll call me then?
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Find out who this Renquist it.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
You got that playing basketball?
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
The forager's back.
I didn't get any chicken.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
What do you want to know?
Ask me them again. One by one.
Burt Reynolds.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
That's a long time.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
What would make you think that?
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
That dazzling imagination.
Who and what is a Drexl?
Yes.
Is this a joke?
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Yeah.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
You're really in love, aren't you?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Clarence...
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Look, Dick, I don't -
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do tell. Why drug related?
No shit?
Keep it.
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
No.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Uh-huh.
Do you believe him?
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
How's he supposed to see the wire?
We gotta get him outta there.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Exactly room-mates.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
No, sir!
I understand.  There'd be no point.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
That's him.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Do you know why you're here, James.
No.
I have to go.
It's just a shot to calm you.
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
See -- you can drive after all!
The gun! ... I lost it
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
It was?  I didn't...know.
You want me to rob him?
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
He's been tested for drugs?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
It is not.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Please, just leave the car alone.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I'm just going to my car.
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
Wasn't nothing.
That a fact?
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I just drove in this morning.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Did you like it; me watching you?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Like they're made of polyester.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
How far is it to California?
From?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
You got a suitcase?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Give him the money.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
John, throw me the keys.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
What happened to your hand?
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
How do you know if you've never tried?
Nice office you've got.
Talk?  About what?
I need thirteen.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
Yeah, well, me too.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
I call the policia.
Senor, you need a doctor.
Hey!  You there!
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
You've got to be--
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
It's not what you think, Jake.
Come on, Jake --
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Twenty-after-ten.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You believe that?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I didn't say it bothered me.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
No.
I don't know how.
Try me.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
The money's right here! Get the key!
Good thinking.  What's all this?
I can't see it.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Why's that?
Where ya goin'?
Where to?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Let me get your change.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Help me, Grace, help...
What about Jeb?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Okay.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Megan?
Would you like to try going--
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
You've never been sick?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
You've misunderstood.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
I thought he was carrying something.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
Are you finished?
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
When?
I mean if you knew karate?
What do you do if something happens?
I'm sleeping in my room.
I'll just shoot him once.
In the passenger car?
Did you get up from your seat?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Rain's coming.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He tell you where them others is?
Oh. How long I been here?
Are you really going to kill them?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Shit and fried eggs.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Books. He's my biographer.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Is... is it... loaded?
He's... he's dead.
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
What for?
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
No.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Huh?
What business?
Shit!
You still think he's in there?
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
You... gonna take... the money?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Three ways?
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
Who said that?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
He's gonna die, ain't he?
We'll bury him.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
What was the money for?
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Goddamnit.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Umm ...
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Me too.
County. I was in for fraud.
No killing?
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
What-are they speaking?
with what?
Who is he?
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Waste of time.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
I know he was good.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Came from Redfoot.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
He wanted me to live.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
I knew him. He would never -
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
I'm fine.
Nothing.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
What is the truth?
It looks that way.
I was her doctor.
Yes.
We went to Code Blue...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
How old are you?
I'm on the staff of...
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Yes.
I...yes.
I do.  Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Do you know who her doctors were?
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
Why is that?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Listen to me, fella...
Exception!
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
This is Miss Costello...?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Yes.  It was, actually.
What...?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
...I have to stand up for her...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
Who told you that?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
One hour.
Should I?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
And when she goes to those places...
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
I -- I --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
About three years.
I told you! Right here!
Will you have dinner with me?
Don't go.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
I like that one.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
The color of your hair...
Wherever you'd like...
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
But why? Why here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
No! Let me go!
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Why?
Only silence. It's always like this.
Would you like a drink of water?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No.
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Yes?! But --
I love you too... too late... too late...
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Would you please go and look?
Her car is gone.
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
What's tomorrow?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
That!?!
Easy, now.
Pop Leibel.
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
Why was the floor wet?
You're pathetic.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
Wait!
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
There's more.
Bury her out in the desert.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Her fucking head was caved in.
So I didn't fucking do it!
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Have you ever done this before?
What?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
They're driving me nuts!
Don't ever stare him down.
I know...
I got you.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
So. When is the wedding.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
What?
She's still working?
Your investment ideas never work out.
But not tonight.
What's goosed?
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
What?
I said, what have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
I don't know...
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
My what?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I don't hate women.
True.
You have a King fantasy.
Take Mexico.
What?
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Sent it.
What else have you forgot?
How could I know what else I forgot?
Don't you dare.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
How do you figure?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
Time out.
I've seen it on television.
What kind of seats can we have?
What?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
Micheal, by accident.
What does that mean?
Like how?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
No...No.
Did she believe you?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Greenpeace.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Good times.
Right.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Which couch?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Who is she?
Yes, it is.
You must think I am a monster.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
Unfortunately ...
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
My God, what have you done to him!
Why the bad temper?
Where's the dough?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Are they going to work here too?
There's been an accident.
Why are you crying?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
How do you feel?
From the terrace.
In English, please.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
I don't know.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
I've seen worse.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
I haven't been working on anything.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
John died.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
What does that mean?
Don't get out of the car.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That's why I'm asking.
More or less.
Then shoot him already.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
No, this is great.
...this is a snappy song....
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
When do we bring'em back?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
What crisis?
It won't hold.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
...but...
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
...they sound what?
In the yellow ribbon.
Anything at the Airport?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Give'em another pill...
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
"...where's my pill..."

Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
You can't tell this story.
No, I'm On Top of it...
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Yes.
What would be true, then.
...by you?
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
A beret.
With their berets...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
No, I think..
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Speak English will ya.
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
About what?
What brings you out here...
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
What'd you tell him?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
...I can't even see it...
I don't understand.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
What if I have a previous engagement?
...isn't it perfect!
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Tony and China?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
They're all human beings
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
I know that.
No, he wouldn't.
I started seeing things.
I didn't want to come.
What's happening to me?
Yes, but...
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Almost.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Um...yes.
Thank you.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
Wow.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
What is it?
You think he killed her?
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Okay.  Okay.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
She's awake.
Fine.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
After that.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Why?
Norman, you have to look at this!
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Did you call about the Feurs?
What's going on, Claire?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Our house.
What am I looking at?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Norman...
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Sweetheart--
Keep your voice down.
I felt you...looking through me...
...I'm positive this time...
It's too rough.
Your wife...
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Leave her out of this!
Claire...
What?
She can't be here without me.
What?
Do you know it?
Mmmuh...
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
Nothing was ever more false.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Who is this...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Who the hel1 -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I don't want the -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
I LOVE him!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
Only you...
HARDER!
you're very --- different.
And whose houses do you design...?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -

Rowan...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
I'm getting --- left behind.
He's got great hands.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
CHIC MAGAZINE?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
Why should I?
What's wrong?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I want you out now
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Is LESLIE here?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
Well?
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
You're way ahead of me again?
Sorry I--
I-I don't have the keys.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
James, what are you doing here?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I don't get the distinction.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
He didn't. He had it built.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
I mean my father.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Not a chance.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
In a hurry, are we?
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
And where might that be?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Then what?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
Just tell us what happened.
The teeth, were they...
Yeah... okay... he did
This wasn't my idea.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
What are you looking at?
Curiosity, I guess.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You can't...
No.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
But she ran away.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
But I..
Yeah, right.
Are you mad at me?
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Shit. Here we go again.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Is this leading somewhere?
That's a lot of butler.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
What way is that?
Thank you.
Know what this is?
Relax.  We're almost there.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
There's only seventy-eight.
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Your guests, ma'am?
Yes sir.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Now it's a bomb.
You managed alright.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
She's in love.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
But what am I gonna transform??
Oooh, this smells terrible.
What'd you bit me for!!
Why?
Who is he?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Talk!  Say something!
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
I've seen pictures.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
You have no right to keep us here.
We do not go into your courts.
Home.
Who are they?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Anything against zippers?
There was.
Say again?
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I am not a child.
I will be the judge of that.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He's not in this building.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
If she?
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Uhhhh -- yes...
This?
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Run, Toto, run!
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Toto, too.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Oh --
No --
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh --
Well, you're perfect now.
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I have so got brains.
Did I scare you?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Oil can what?
He said his mouth.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
What happened?
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
Yeah. Me?
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
I haven't slept in weeks.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
It's a whatzis?
You don't get around us that easy!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
No, her dog!
...Tin Man!
Quiet!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
It makes you nervous?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Hes sealed himself in.
Do you know what youre doing?
Weve got to get out.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Constructions not exactly my line.
Old friend?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Does this look familiar to you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
He used your exact words.
You, of course. I need some information.
Where did you get this?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Warm.
He was a...good lover?
This is the end.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Jon -- what??
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
What??
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
What do you mean, frame-up?
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
No comment.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
Am I free to go?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Adrian.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
Up yours.
Is that all?
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
"Anarchy" 99"?
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Aren't you afraid?
Yorgi and Kirill.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Alright, so I'll get more.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
Sorry, "dude".
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Help me with this guy.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
What does that mean?
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
If necessary.
Where am I?
The point of what?
How?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
I lost him.
The way what is going to be?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Is it that music?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Of course.
You're incorrigible!
No, of course not.  I just meant...
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
This is the only library I know of.
How long will this whole thing take?
I didn't do that.
Vermicelli.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
Are you putting me on?
I beg your pardon?
Wockers with the knockers???
What are you doing here?
But what you were doing?
Taking the book along?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
That's not bad.
Throw the third switch!
You'll be getting me sad next.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Are you busy?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Oh, doctor!
I'd be so nervous.
Give him the sedative!
Did you do it?
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I will.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Look how far we've come.
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
