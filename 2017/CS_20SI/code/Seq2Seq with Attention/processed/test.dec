Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Tons
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Queen Harry?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
What?
As in...
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Why not?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
It's a lung cancer issue
She's partial to Joey, not me
Then, go get her
Where?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
A hundred bucks a date.
Are you lost?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
I dazzled him with my wit
Acting the way we do.
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Is that right?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Funny.
No, Daddy.
Hi.
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Kat a fan, too?
Just for now.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
With the teeth of your zipper?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Pirate -- no question.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
You did the same to your God!
Passion is something one cannot control!
What are you saying?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
God be with us admiral.
Come over here.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
You must be mad...!
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yes, but he was a cop.
They won't until this is over.
Yeah.  This way.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
I'm sorry.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Go on.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Takin' a bath.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Yeah.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
Mind if I ride along with you?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
You're ruthless.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Dog food.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Okay.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
You said speak Czech!
Don't want to film this?
Why not?
Did you hurt her?
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
She's wonderful.
It's possible.
Roger.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Did they have any explanation for this?
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Vodka.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Goodbye.
You're gonna help us take him.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Luther was part of the gang?
Want to try it again?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Must be billy's girl.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You sure that's the reason?
Yeah. Guess not.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
I didn't have the time.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I still don't think it's loaded.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
That's the way I see it, too.
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Jack?  What was that?
Fuck you.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
So what?
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
That's no bull.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Can't complain.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
She dropped in on me... holding this.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...Leeloo.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
We will be ready, Lord.
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
It's like a cab isn't it?
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
Cornelius..
Oh god!
You get that off the screen?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Why?... Why would you need me?
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Options.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
How's our deal coming along?
Your clothing reeks of it.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
What?
I'm telling you...
Hmm.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Sure.
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Move it, dirtbag... !
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
I'm not so sure about this.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
What did you do with her body?
I never killed anyone.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
I'm listening.
Fuck you.
Yeah... guess so.
Pardon me?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
He succeeded.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
You don't have any other choice.
You're joking.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Neil... Neil Cole.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
You should be.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
It's been six years.
What... ?
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
You could do worse.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
I know.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Is there something we can do?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Nice neighborhood.
She knew she was gonna die.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
My name is...
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
To take a picture.
Sobering...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
I've got to go.
But Dad --
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Then we'll find another way.
That's their problem.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
All of us.  Right?
I can't listen to this.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Yes?
So they caught up with you, too?
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
The sound again?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
I met Dr. Kent, once.
After torpedo room:  Report!
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
- for horrors like yourself?
Why?
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
All right - go to it.
Who?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Same old shit.
This spring.
Yeah.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
We bought you.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah?
Open the door. We're late.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
What do you want, then?
I'm fine, fine.
Maybe.
We should talk.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
For a while.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Tonight. Let's get together.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Jack doesn't need money.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Oh, Wade.
You've been married twice --
Good.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Marg! You got orders!
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Call it what you want.
Well, it was an accident.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
That it wasn't an accident.
Money.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Your father never means to be so...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Yes dear?
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Got it.
Got it.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
This doesn't make sense.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
To swear you in as President.
Roger.
Ga get it.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Come on, Alice.
That was war.
Three...
You'll do it?
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Both of you.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Twenty-five years.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
What word would you use, Elaine?
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Don't be too long.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
What...?
I don't want to live anymore.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
What should I say?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
He had fish.
Well...
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I will, but Jim won't.
Huh?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
Yes...
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Do it!
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
My wife?  She worries about me.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
We?  You've taken it?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
We can't let him get away.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Yeah.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Yeah, I'll bet.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
What?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
They're but off!  Do something!
What's the question?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
We didn't miss anything.
No.  Have you?
Fuck you.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Just get back here!
Yeah.  What?
What about me?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
I'm sorry, Newt.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Yes.  A little girl.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Sure.  Go left.
Newt, wait!
Can we dream?
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
I'm so relieved.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Yes!
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
You borrowed money from your mother?
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Yes!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Oh, damn!
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
No one.
I understand.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
What for?
But! I'm a married woman!
Leave him alone!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Wine?
Majesty.
Well. There it is.
Oh?
Yes, indeed.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Twenty-six.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Am I not welcome?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
It's a secret.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
What medicine?
Is he working?
That's right.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Yes.
Why not?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
How could it not, Excellency?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
A Mass for the dead.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
This is only a vaudeville.
Finish what?
He knows. He knows!
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Come. Let's begin.
Yes.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Exactly. A dance.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
About what?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Are they?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
You cannot say that!
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
But not his body.
I've seen the manuscript.
I agree, Baron.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Come with me. And stay in the room.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
The American? Yes, duck.
What exactly did he call out?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
Warn him?
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Right.
I thought you were asleep.
I know.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Will you come with me?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Bathroom.
The bedroom.
It's nice to see you.
Good.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Okay.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
No.
No what?
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No.
No.
No what?
I think he's a Jew.
You did, did you?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
That's a wolf's head.
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
It's a five-pointed star.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
Come on, I'm freezing.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
I heard that.
Yeah?
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Let's just keep walking.
Walk away, Jack.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Matt?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Take it easy, Clark.
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
Get out, get out!
That don't do us any good.
Me?
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
See, we're getting along famously!
Well, what?
Why are you so anxious?
I want to be near you!
Oh, yeah?
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Much better this morning, thank you.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
The theatre?
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, sir.
I can't tell you.
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
But I haven't . . .
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
Yes.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
I'm afraid so.
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Oh, Charlie again.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
All right, dear.
They must have turned him down.
Are you sure?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Now you tell us.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
... Will Perry ...
Tell me.
I think I recognize you.
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Don't let it happen again.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
Well?
The brown one.
Cole, he didn't mean that.
Then why can't I go in there?
Died a hero.
I think he's already feeling better.
Such as?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
You are a charmer.
Don't care.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
And we're good at it.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Me neither.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
What?
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
I'm not hanged yet.
Right here in church?
Communion.
You been with a girl ever?
This time we'll make an exception.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Good.
Yes sir.
Just perfect.
We did.
I look forward to seeing it.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
I can't believe this.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What is that?
Pumpkin?
This is Dorsia?
What do you want, Courtney?
You and...Luis?
Yes, Courtney?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
Nice.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I won't...don't worry.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Commes des Garcon.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Maybe it's just the light.
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Leaving what?
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
After six.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Patrick? Is that you?
Jean-I'm not-
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Hello 
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Okay. Do.
Don't tell him you're here.
You're at Paul Owen s.
No.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Understandable.  Lime?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Nice. Very nice.
I know. I'm sorry.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Actually, yes.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Shhhh...it's okay.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Yes, it is.
You are a fanatic.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
What're you -- what?
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Guilt?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Prick.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Okay. I'm Gary.
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
Oh. Yeah.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
You look a little tired.
'Have a look?
Sure.
'Sorry about the late notice...
You see what's hanging on the wall?
You do?
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
You're famous around here.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Why's that?
But why would they --?
He's out of prison?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Certainly not at my happy home.
What about "60 Minutes."
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
Oh.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Please don't go.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Let's try #2.
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
What d'you mean?
What does that mean?
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Yeah, yeah.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Care for some saki?
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Hungry.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm sorry.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I am not.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Indeed.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Sea bass.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
... head ...
There, look!
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
To you ... ?
To find out who killed my husband.
Thanks, Valentine ...
You killed my husband.
Too many cooks --
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
I'm already married ...
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
I didn't. Mother did.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
For a man in my position --
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
No trouble.
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
As a matter of fact I have ...
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Decontamination -- ?
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Who's now vanished.
She may try to kill you.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Where?
Both, actually.
But did they teach you this?
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
What is this person's story here?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
What are we having?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
I can't sleep.
You're really pissing me off.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Screw you!
What are you...
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
I want women.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
It's Bullwinkle.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Rick!
Oh, no!
No, Brett, I...
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
What's this?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
My Debbie?
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Roll the hose.
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
You're back.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Who's doing this?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I don't work for them, either.
What?
You look like... Brian.
Every little boy's fantasy.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Coffee sucked.
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
Well, let's have a look.
Cute.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Yeah? When was the last time?
Who's this?
I need to get in the trunk.
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
Who?
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
I forgive you.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
Did he gots to be.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Well you did.
Yeah, him.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
But the line has to be drawn.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I've never been given a fair shot.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Who are the other characters?
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Manray!
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Which one is your brother?
The big one.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
For what?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
Light?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
I don't believe it.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
What's a Negro.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
You tellin' the truth.
Oh her.
She hates dem.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...like fried and chicken...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
How be dat?
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
Oh you do, huh?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Say what, Manray?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
And his baggage?
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Yes, sir.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Not one.
It is my only object.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Papa?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
We found him like this --
It's... too slow.
You did Basic here?
You saved Kendall's life --
We've found all of them.
How do you know that?
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Sir, yes, sir!
West... he's dead.
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
We just want to check your pack --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
If not you, then who?
Why?
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't --
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Home, I'm done.
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Why?
Something like that. You?
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
What?
Dunbar.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Yeah.
So did I.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Want company?
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
The fuck are you talking about --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
We know.
Sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Why?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You learned from the best.
She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
Oh, so you know.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
Really.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
There's over eighty thousand here.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Good. 
Right.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Yes.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Okay we won't talk about it.
I don't have nothing.
Are you scared?
What?
She's dead.
What's your name?
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
Okay. Promise?
I'm sorry.
Please.
No. What? No. I know.
Tell me about it.
Oh! Gave me a start.
At church?
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
You need a ride?
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Let go...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Come on, gal...
How long... how long I been out?
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Whose doin' is that?
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Now, hold up.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
I do.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
You feelin' sick?
Are you wasted?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Let go...
I said let's go, Charlie.
I hope not.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Cool?
Where would you look for the mafia?
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Why the hell not?
Why weren't you at the platform?
Are we getting married?
Because he knows how to get to our man.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
What do you chant?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Why would you care?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Yeah.
Why?
You're foreigners.
You had my help, detective.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
You certainly have a nice place here.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Dr. Tyrell?
His company made us.
No.
This afternoon.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Industrial refuse.
Garbage man?
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
Got it.
You start.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
But if you could?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Does it eat?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I've already got more help than I need.
Me and my dad.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
Uh-huh.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
I'll see you in a minute.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
The machine works.  She is.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Of course.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I don't have one.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Yes?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
For how long?
Oh, brother...
Eve? I'm leaving.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Here, pick these up!
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
What is it?!
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why doesn't it never work out?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
What's fair?
Sure.
They like Dr. Pepper.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
I don't want to be alone.
Sure.
They're all divorced?
Thank you.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Uh...yeah.
That's boring!
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
What?
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Why?
Because he must!
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
I love Lucy!
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
Oh. I see.
What?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
My father is a genius.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Sorry, Mom!
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Yes, ma'am.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
What about relatives?
Good.
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Well, put it down and come in!
Yes.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Yes, dear!
You have tranquilizers?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Excuse me.
I want him to at least see the sky!
Amen.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I see "elegant."
No.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Or have perfect table manners.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
What?!
We'll find him.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Okay.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey nothing.
Never before this.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Yes, I like you.
What?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Falling.
Hello.
Dorothy. No!
I want you to stay with me.
You look beautiful to me.
It's okay. It's okay.
My secret lover.
Alright, suit yourself.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Nothing.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Alright.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Yeah, I know.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
I'll get a coat for her.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
It's good to see you, Dad.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
OK.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay. Great!
It's okay.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Sandy?
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
BLAME...
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
Aye.
Aye.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
He got beat up by a girl.
Okay. We're ready.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
You... oh god, why?
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Sweet-n-low!
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Y-Yes my son.
Forgive me father.
Just go!
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
She's an attractive older woman.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Yeah, I saw it.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Like he meant it.
What do you think?
As long as he gets out OK.
Maybe he just went to the store.
This morning.
You were asleep.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Can you hand me those french fries.
Would of been nice.
We need a car.
I don't think we can do that.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
I'm not. But there's --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Ah. Couple days ago.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Who's Mr. Henry?
He was all right.
Any activity?
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Get against the wall!
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Thanks.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
It feels good.
No. Bob did.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
What was that?
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Nothing. I was just asking.
Dies y nueve.
Cuba.
Yeah.
Bob! Get back in position!
That never would of --
Let's cut the bullshit.
What are you talking about, Bob?
It's true, Dignan.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
He electrocuted someone?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
See you in a little while.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Bullshit.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
That's OK.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Yeah?
Let's go!
Wait a second --
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
He said what?
And what does that cover?
Well, I think --
Well, I left some money in there.
Got a little lucky.
What?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Good to know you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
What?
Never heard of it.
I want to know what happened.
May I finish?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
And?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
I don't want you to forgive me.
You know I'm not.
Is this really happening?
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
I don't know.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
But it ends up the same.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Where --
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
-- hang on --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
What if it's not who you think it is?
But you found another choice.
I did.
I only dream about people who are dead.
Yes.
Get on it.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
I want to hear it from you.
A Russian?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Your first assignment was Geneva.
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Are you disappointed?
Sounds like a threat.
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
What?
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
Is there. Is all there.
Still...
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Did you?
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Are we locked up?
By who?
It was in Latin, sir.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Fourteen? --
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
That's just a dream, William!
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
How many?
That depends on the man.
A common thief.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Thank you for accepting.
You are. And I'll come again.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I need you so much! I love you!
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Who would do such a thing?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Great. I'll see you soon.
You know my father?
Where are you now?
No, protecting her.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Books?
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Fuck off, frat boy.
Hi, Lenny.
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
So it didn't feel... weird?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
What do you mean?
Stop! Take me back!
I was?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
And you are...?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Meant no offense.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh, yes.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
I'm sorry. It is.
Yes, Monsieur.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
No thanks, Carl.
Monsieur Rick!
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
I'd better be going.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
You haven't heard my offer.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Well, so long.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Occupied France?
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
Yes, of course, we --
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You can believe that if you want to.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Does he always leave so early?
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
-- Is what?
Thank you. I try.
Go ahead.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
Thank you.
No. It's all arranged.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
I expected no less, Captain.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
I never make plans that far ahead.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Get me the Radio Tower!
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
No.
Yeah, boss?
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Thirsty.
Do too much, I'll die.
No.
Nothing out there but ocean.
No.  that was the last one.
Must be a story there.
Yes there is.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I thought you might have.
My epitaph.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
What's going on down there?
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
That's what it's about.
Permission granted.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
What do you want me to *do*?
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Please don't...
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
I can't go nowhere.
Nobody ever wants me!
You mean somebody asked?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
What's an immigrant?
A B-24 Liberator.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
Yes, for both.
It looks like scurvy.
It's my turn!
I don't think so.
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
I told him that you all is sick.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Silicon Valley?
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Today? Started off great...
Guess so.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
We'll take care of it.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
What's a King Pin?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
So what? We just stay clear of him.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
No. Just confidence.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
I'll worry about Customs.
I don't trust anyone.
I gotta go get a haircut.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Did I miss something?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Don't ruin this for me.
Sounds respectable.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Breasts.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
You sure?
I'm sorry.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Keep it up.
Sorry. What?
A Fed? Is he close?
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Not like Matt, you mean.
We all played the field.
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I want to hear it.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
It will.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
I want to buy a car.
Well, thank you anyway.
So why did you come to my casino?
In the casino.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
You don't like cheats, do you.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Turn left at the lights.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
No.
We check every four days.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
I think he's talking to it.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Of course not.
Any of 'em any good?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
No kidding?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
No?
Yeah?
What?
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Who's Camille?
Don't look down.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I ain't mad at you...
Am I?
Yeah, me too.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You lost me.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
Your basic hodge-podge.
Hardly...
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I'm sorry.
Well, not me personally.
I don't know what to say.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
None.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
You and me both.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Later.
Right, the big one-oh.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
I'll give it my best shot.
Easy Sketchy.
True, but--
I want you on call here.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
More than anything in the world.
Yeah, a man's drink...
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
The paint!
DUDES!
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
And if it ain't cleaned off?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Sure.
Hawk?
They're what?
Check.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Uhh... nothing.
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
A bustier?
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
GOOD MORNING!
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Not until like... eighth grade.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Who is... we?
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
We went to a hotel.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Hey...
What makes you think I'm not?
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
You want to kiss me...
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Infant Memory Generators.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
No. Frank.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Follow him where?
I met a girl.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Can anyone else see him?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
God exists because you're horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Then how is time travel possible?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Congratulations.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Oh God, I'm dead...
You-betcha.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
Your parents'd kill you.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
C'mere. I love you so much.
I love you much.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Bitch!
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Okay... well, bye.
Oh, naw. Hi.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
So? Be real easy.
Ohio...
All right, then.
Yeah.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
"My dear"...
Is that all?
Yes -- why?
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
What other job you got?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
What do I get?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You worm!
Yes.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
That's it...
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Your Excellency!
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
One or two?
I've always thought that myself.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
What do you mean?
Hmmm?
That I am very little different from him.
Like this. 
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Never mind that, I want my man!
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
I could easily arrange...
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Please do.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
I don't know what I've got.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes!
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Good morning.
John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
I thought as much.
Oh no, I couldn't.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
A dressing bag?
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Yes.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
Yes -- I believe you do.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
You're just saying that.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Why?
Yes... oh, yes...
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
Oh, thanks.
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
Odin!
He was lucky...  Sit there.
Don't you FEEL it?
What's it all about?
Who have you been talking to?
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
The sun! That's it!
So?
Look... Erik...
Like fish.
To the oars!
But how could he know... unless...
How about making friends?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
We haven't got a spare place.
You're wasting your time.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
You liar!
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
Hi.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
I'm sure you would.
Yeah, I got it.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Yeah.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Frost?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
You pick it.
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I think about that.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah? Oh, great!
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
When?
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
I know.
Um, no.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Joel, come here. Please.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
You must have been crazy.
How's it going?
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
You have to stop this!
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
In a minute.
Very cool. Trippy.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Nothing.
I know what it is.
Then why did you ask me?
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
Well, where was Patrick?
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Jesus.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Just wanted to let you know.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I'm staying with the Countess.
I don't.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
I have to go, Julian.
I was a successful model once.
Bonanza Jellybean?
A job for me?
But Countess...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Roger that.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
It gets worse.
A power drain --
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
...how's the client?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Negative.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Yes...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Watch me.
Then who the fuck are you?
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
We have a situation here...
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
That's enough!
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Get out of there now!
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
What's causing the readings?
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
I've got a theory.
What's going on in there, Starck?
Blow it up?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
I did.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
I don't care.
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
Is it safe?
Oh, he did.
About me? How sweet.
I already got it. Everything I want.
You'd never know it.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
He's made a few changes.
I should have done more, run more tests --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
We're working as hard as we can --
I though we went over this.
They're not costumes.
Then what is it?
Passion.
What? What do you mean you --
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Raising the shields.
Arnold. What's happening?
It's the first door on your left.
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Okay, Dennis.
Ugh.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
All right, I take it back.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her number?
I would. Yeah.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Chicken!
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
I thought he was out of town.
He is.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I know.
What variables?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
It was okay.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Thanks a lot.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
No. But it's a nice idea.
No.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
I want romance.
I don't know.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Yes.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Oh... yes.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
What's April 16th?
Anything to drink?
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Naw! Not a major.
Las Vegas.
This is my granddaughter...
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
I have to go.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Whatever's right.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Extract of pineal!
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
I fear nothing.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
With what just happened upstairs --
Where's that?
There's a tunnel.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Look.
Who's with me?
My truck.
What?
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Nothing.
Seven.
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
No bullshit.
Gimme the keys.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
If he doesn't shut up...
I'm sure.
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
Nothing, just lookin'.
Let's lock off this room.
I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Who is she?
Where's Clifford?
Right now we have to be practical.
Without me.
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
We'll get you home, Frances.
Were you a drug addict?
I didn't have much to do with it.
I know.
Of course.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I love you too, Francie.
Thank you.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Address?
Occupation?
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Then don't go to Hollywood.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Harry... I met someone.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
The hell you will, Harry York.
What for?
I took the early rounds.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
What?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
What's that?
To quarter-horses.
No. To thoroughbreds.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
How did I look?
Yes.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
What?
I already have.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Mama...?
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Frances, I'm warning you...
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
What?
Yes.
The music? Or the fire?
Why do you not go to them?
You speak.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
I see it before me.
Materials. Nothing more.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
I don't know.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
And if I consent?
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
God took her from us.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I wish to be your wife.
I give you my soul...
No. But someday.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Very well then.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
No. He had more important work.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Why?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
You told her to sweep the courts.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
I don't know.
Almost five.
Okay.
Marcie?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I can't, Barry...
Thanks.
A short somewhere.
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
That's thirty percent.
For two lonely nights.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
I have no idea.
Thank you, son.
Sorry, I need everybody.
Yes, she is.
Real McCoy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Yes.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
In the Winnebago.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
What do you think Mom would say?
What's in Mexico?
I'm really sorry.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Whatsamatter?
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
You believe me don't cha?
One... Two... Three.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What does that mean?
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
California.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Sounds familiar.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Do that.
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Just a coincidence?
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
How hard they making it on you?
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
I don't know, I don't care.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Which is guy-speak for...
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
You got anybody, Wick?
Last time I didn't.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
"Dad."
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
15, sir.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
We are so fucked.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
We know, Audrey.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
No.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
That's the problem. He did.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
And you're beautiful...
Oh, I'm not married.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Allez, allez!
That is when we will go in.
That is our job.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Are you sure? How do you know?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Leadership....
Must be some sort of mining facility.
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Alex? Where are you going?
Nobody was WATCHING?
Down there.
No I didn't.
Oh.  Okay.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
There is no weather in space.
We need another one.
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Computer, can it be repaired?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Catch me later, okay?
Former Commander?
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Pedal to the metal...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Delighted, sir.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Lafayette is a child!
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
I only meant...
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land.
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You know very well who it is that I love.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
You're out of your mind!
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
About sixty.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
That's right, me.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Tell you what...
You positive about that?
That's the magic number.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Depends. Who's this?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Ray. Look at me.
That's correct. Look at me.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
Something shouldn't be there.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
Where you been, Harry?
That's what I'm doing.
But you work for the casino?
So you don't work for the casino?
Ever shot anybody.
For a movie?
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
Read it. It's a grabber.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I had to tell 'em something.
His shrink's trainer.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
Who?
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
We talk different?
You mean like we don't give a shit.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
That's not bad.
Okay. I'm listening.
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
They report it to the IRS.
Here's another tip...
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I know what a vig is.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I just caught the end.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You bet.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
That's what the guy said.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
I'm going.
Mob guy?
Say again. Over.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
That's what it says.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Or uninvited guests.
Seen a lota movies.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Why not?
The right way and the wrong way.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
Three, four days.
She take a radio?
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Right.
Headache, nausea, lights?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
So what did happen?
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
But, who -- ?
The same day she supposedly went down.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Showing you what?
What happened.
Just lucky I guess.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Looks like it's adrift.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
You don't remember?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
Fine with me.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I guess.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Jesus...
Can I come in?
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
What?
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
You loser.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Forget it...
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
You can have that one.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
I'm going to tell him you said that.
She says she wants to MMPH!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
Bingo!
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
Oh yeah...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Fuck you, bitch!
Why don't you ask him.
I didn't get it either.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
It's a surprise.
Anthony's II!
You cunt!
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
He gives me a total boner!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
Go ahead...
How repulsive!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
I said "great"...
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Nothing.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Punk rock is over!
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Get a job!
Yes.
I did too!
Later, "Dude".
What?
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Every guy has a type!
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Well are --
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Jesus, Seymour.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Oh, hi...
What? You're kidding me...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
No, of course not.
In whatever way you think I mean.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I-I-I...
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I don't know... where is she, then?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
That slut!
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
You've never built in Africa.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
But overall, you're pleased?
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. 
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
You mean nobody died?
What did I do?
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
Not even close.  What happened?
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
You're right.  We should stay.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
My pleasure.
Command me, lord.
Like what?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Good idea.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
Well don't think!
Well, thanks a lot.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
That's a violin concerto.
What?
I told you, I ...
Yeah, yeah.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I want to help you.
Who's the stiff?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I see.
Print is dead.
Is that a game?
In the physical sense.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
Yes.  I don't like this.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Yeah, I can smell it.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Does she want to be?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Fourteen hundred.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
I'm sure, I don't know.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
What are you talking about?
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
Send them out!
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
That's difficult to say, general.
Gladly Caesar.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
On what charge?
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
Give away food?
Take grain away from the army?
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
He left us at dawn.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
You're hearing about somebody else.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
They're studying with Cynics.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
No!
Narcissus!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Chain him.
Think about it!  Just think about it!
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
No.
Yes.
No.
Where is the car?
I do.
Ah. Where?
I've never been to it.
Come in.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
All right then! Yes!
Elaine -- I love you.
What did she say?
You've got to tell me what she said.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Oh.
I don't know.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
Is that so? You might marry me?
I have to go back now.
Tomorrow?
Carl who?
The day after tomorrow?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Are you listening?
What are you then?
What?
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
I am going to call the police now.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh no.
No.
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Let's go.
When is he coming back?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Well I don't know.
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Thank you for taking me home.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Yes?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
You can admit that, can't you?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Oh.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
How many times a year.
Is it?
Well I can't.
Art?
Well how did it happen?
How do you think.
I'm curious.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Are you?
Did I say that?
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Where is Elaine?
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Meet someone?
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Different.
You got me.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
No, it's not --
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Can you look through the glass.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
How?
I'll pay you back.
How?
You?
Dictation.  You know...
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Too bad.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You're very funny --
Money.
Why?
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
I want to be alone.
What can you see?
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Why later?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
If I could get into a game I might win some.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
As you will.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
Send his bags up to my room.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
No - absinthe.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
You're trembling.
Preysing?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
That's from skiing.
Perhaps. 
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Oh, yes.
You're sweet.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Why not?
I wish to be alone.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Good night.
Well -- gentlemen.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
Well...
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I want to know everything about you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
Working the what?
Myra, I'm not following this.
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
I don't think I need it.
Maybe I like it where I am.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
No, its -- Why did she--?
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Well, when you put it that way.
Girl scouts.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Forget it.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
Nothing.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I was trying to get away from someone.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
That would work.
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I can see that.  Why?
Who?!
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
He's in the bathroom.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
We can light our own tree at home.
Answer what?
You've been watching too much TV.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Who are you?
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Him.
Retiring.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
What'll you do for transportation?
Go home!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
So long, Colonel.
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
How do you know that?
I dunno.
You never played a violin.
Everybody thinks that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Our pleasure.
Pass the fucking catsup.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Thank God!
As a matter of fact--
They were in the same creative writing class.
College?
What's good about that?
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Disease?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
The doctor.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And no one's there now?
Why not?
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He knows you shattered his violin.
Hope.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Load it for her.
Do it, Norbert.
Ooops.
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
None.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
You've been bitten by bats?
Are you've seen it work cures?
We have, have we?
What for?
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Don Quixote.
You didn't even find that out?
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Premature ejaculation.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
He's a ghost!
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Is he all right?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
She quit this afternoon.
It is?
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
Meaning?
Why would you do that?
We've got to rescue him.
It's a jungle out there.
How neat.  How keen.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
He died of a massive rupture.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
You mean I'm black?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Yeah.
I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Wait?
Just one.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Um-hm. Live sound.
Do you know where she would be?
Half now, half later.
Jesus.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
No.
They were here?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
It's not quite the same thing.
They are the same.
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Well, what do they know?
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
Who's paying you?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
No.
Hmm.
The police? They know less than you do.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
Get out.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
It's just a name.
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Pretty good.
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Okay.
No.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
You ever play Chicken?
I'm worried about Jake.
Huh?
At least I improved myself. What's up?
Thanks.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Could I see your registration?
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
That's really great.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
What is it?
But we can't just dig it up!
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
It is kind of rough.
Well, I don't...
Well, why don't you?
No. I'd feel stupid.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Oh, Harold. 
But why now?
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Harold!
Perhaps it is.
No. My uncle.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Ah, yes.
No.
What else do you like?
Huh?
No.
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
No.  I'd have liked to.
Eh?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
What's the chance of getting one of these?
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Time to play.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Who?
Didn't even buy me a drink.
No. It's not.
That makes him more than a hundred --
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Got tired of me?
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Who?!
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Don't move. We --
Good night.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Red, I --
A brute.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
My fucking hand!
Got her mother's looks.
Lucky man.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
What happened to you?
Back from where?
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
What do you want me to do.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Maybe.
Well we can't just stay here --
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
O.K. O.K.
Ah!
The best part of ten years.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
No. I'll do it.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
That's right.
Am I?
Steve.
No Dad.
Do you want me to come over?
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Never better. You sleep well.
What?
Of course.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Show her.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Not that late.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Sure. Why not?
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Sonic Death Monkey.
No, you can't.
They always seemed...
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
You'd love it!
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
Is there a difference?
What's his name?
Yeah, sure...
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
-- FUCK OFF!
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
I dunno.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
You really believe that?
Not really.
Just the obvious stuff.
It sounds stupid.
Is what better?  Better than what?
I haven't felt like it.
I guess.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
That bad, eh?
Mmm hmm.
Do you want me to be there?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
C'mon.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How?  How were we the same people?
But what?
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Harder.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Wanna go to dinner?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
We took care of that.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Everything go alright?
It's a great song.
Yup.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
God, you ask a lot of questions.
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
No, we...
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Happy birthday.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Why?
Anything in Maryland is close.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Dupont Circle.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
He was innocent.
You're a fool.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
It's beautiful.
I hope I never get that old.
That would be difficult to explain.
Yes.
Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
You and I should talk first.
Spare me the details.
What are you getting at, Moran?
All I need is for you to check the name.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
Your name is Conor?
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Please go to no trouble.
Pheasant.
Why are you here?
You will live.  Survive.
But why be so concerned about me?
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Of course.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Certainly not me.
You're wrong.
Romirez is dust.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Not likely.
It never changes, Major.
Must he go?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Thanks.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
Leave her out of this.
I want you to come to me.
What are you getting at?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Oh yes, more than enough.
His only kid.
Open this door!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
I'll come a-running, pardner.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hello, Bruce...
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Fine.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Where are we going?
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Out of the mouths of babes.
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
What?!!
I haven't any hard feelings.
You can break it, can't you?
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Say, could I meet him?
Thanks.
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
All right, Walter.
What tickets?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Is this the Community Hospital?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Flip a coin.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Beats king up.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
I'll have it in a minute.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
Hold her, boys!
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Fred!
If there was any way out...
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
My name is Louis Peluso.
What did you do with her?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Where's the money?
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Never mind! Just play dead.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
The City Sealer's office!
You can't bribe me!
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
I give that marriage six months.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
Bugger off.
You wouldn't.
Would.
I'm starting my own collection.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Who pays for them?
I don't know?
Kiss me Hardy.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
I will if you will!
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
It looks....foreign.
Where to?
Just ignore her, Mac.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
No, I won't.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Couple more miles up this road.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
You shouldn't a done that.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
I don't.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Really fucking awesome.
What's that?
Way out here?
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
That seems likely.
Yeah?
When you were outside with Bill.
Shhhhhh.
Shhhhhh.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
That's the understatement of the year.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Firefly.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Who's your Daddy!
Well, go get her.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Right.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Right...  ...come on.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
It's going famously, son, famously!
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Oui, doctor, oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
You are sweet.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Fine.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
I've got some things to tell you.
That's Lila?
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Okay. If you think it will help.
What do you mean?
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
No. I married a midget.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Oh, Rosie.
Shut up, you.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
How's it going?
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
What's the larger experiment?
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'm sorry?
No biggie.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
Why certainly!
Oh, and the sun block?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I don't know. Something.
It's perfect!
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
That's great.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
I guess.
Such as what womanly things?
That was wonderful!
Absolutely!
Should I come with?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Okay. That's fair.
Yahoo!
Even better.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
here, here.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Yes.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
You know what's good for him?
What did he say?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Character.
I got drunk.
Whaddya been so far?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
To do what?
For who?
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
All right. Five hundred.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
Fifty per cent?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Give me a drink, will ya?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Now and then. Why, do you?
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Yeah. You must come again.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
How long have you been waiting?
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Then why go to the bus station?
No, not always.
I used to be an actress.
I'm not.
So why go to college?
What do you do on the other days?
I could always get us a bottle.
Come here.
At school. It's Thursday.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Raw.
I've got something in my bag.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
No. You?
Is he a winner?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
I'm a little tired.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Yes.
What about... now?
We move.  Place to place.
You know what I mean.
Shhh... don't talk.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
You got that right.
Round back.
What did it look like?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I'll take you to school.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Where, Jimmy?
The State Police.
All their lines were busy.
What kind, Mom?
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
You still got the Olds?
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
I can't shake her free.
Then God help us.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
Yes, Sir.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Butt-munch.
I'm a dancer.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
It's all fuzzy.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
That'd be cool!
You sure?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
But, Mr. President...
So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
And before here?
Die.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
And I am his.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
The Name of God...
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
How dare he?!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
That was our assessment as well.
You could be more right than you know.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
The Grail Diary.
All I have to do is scream.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Thank God!
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Look, can we discuss this later?
What?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
It's a new experience for me.
Junior...
What did you find, Dad?
Ready.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
You should have been there...
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Why they glow like that?
Why?
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
What evil?
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
A snake!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
A what?!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
So now they believe me.
Al.
Your name is Al...
What street?
My place, can't you see?
No.
Yeah...Who?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why not?
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
I am. You are.
I'll sue.
Take a left and your next right.
The man.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
You leave my glands alone!
Just get there.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
What can I do? You're on your own.
What?
Where are you staying?
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Not blue enough.
It lends you an air of mystery.
Not her. You!
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
I told you, I have a feeling...
Never mind, just say it.
While he makes the run.
Where?
And Dieter?
I'll get us out of here.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
Good.
Let us get to the border!
Newer, more powerful design.
That crazy guy?
It's just money.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
He's not an ordinary man.
Your memory.
It may have been affected.
Thanks.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
Take the card.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Not you. Them.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Nothing.
What?
Then who did?
Haven't seen you around.
What way?
I just work for the travel firm.
That you're not crazy.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
This going to work?
I can't fly it.
Now what?
If he was able, what would he say.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Yes.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?
That remote control thing?
There's Dad, on TV.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
What do you mean, what's it do?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
You ready...?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Try the car.
Soy sauce...
Right now?
I don't understand.
No, thank you.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Good.
What?
I'm with Don on this.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
If you want to do it.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I don't think you really understand --
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I told the truth... I told the truth.
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
You're gonna get your fix...
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
You threatening my family, now, too?
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Howard!
What part?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
We rest, Your Honor.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
Thanks, buddy.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
What is your husband's profession?
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Well, don't look at mine!
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Have you tried the duck?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Miles?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
From a -- girlfriend.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
Hello Marylin.
What kind of "stuff?"
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
I fell in love Miles.
You do? You do love me?
It's okay Joe.
Hello Miles.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Please!
So. Now what?
Do you know him?
I wish I had your discipline.
Well what does he want?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Shit.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
She's here now.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Video.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Who's "Patty."
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
You ought to know why. Because
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
No.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
No, I'll go through with it.
Is that his name?
Are you going to see him?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back. 
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
What would you like to have me do?
Sock her!
Yes, sir.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
What do they say?
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
Yes.
You must have me confused with
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
You have your nerve!  Here, boy!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Nope. No complaints.
Must be the Spring.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Well, you were!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
To New York?
I'm following you.
Okay. Hang on to these.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Well, take them off.
knowbut
Hitch-hiking.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
I hate the horrid stuff.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
You! Don't make me laugh.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Darling!
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Why not?
Congratulations.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
You bet we did.
Whatever you say, darling.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Oh, excuse me. 
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Get out!
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
What's the thousand bucks for?
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
You!
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Listen, Palyou've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
I ain't got a hat.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Mebbe.
I don't trust him.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
Whyno
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Did he pay?
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Hi, Freckle Face.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
How many men?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
They're gonna love you, chief.
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
Are they?  Why would they?
No, it can't!
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Virginia.
What are they?
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
Yes, Max, I understand.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
What's her name?
Okay.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I thought you might want a drink?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Shit.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
No, you didn't. What branch?
With ten thousand? Nine.
The Delfonics.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How'd you feel about it?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
For now. These relationships never last too long.
You talk them into it?
You don't actually do it that way?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
He was here?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Why?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Did you do it that night?
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I told him I might.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Can I smoke?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
You know what we want.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
So what happens now?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Keep it between us girls?
You betcha.
Got some o.j.?
They told me.
All your money's in Mexico.
How the fuck they know that?
Didja tell 'em anything else?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
That's the idea.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
It's a diet thing?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
C'mon, don't lie.
About five years ago.
And your point is?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Okay, Lou-is.
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
Which one is for the car?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
So you're sure she's dead.
In the chest and stomach.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Max Cherry.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
I think I do. Is that good enough?
I know that.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Uh-huh.
In a way, yes.
Yeah.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
You know it's for you.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
He's around.
Take me home.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What isn't happening?
It's all been a dream.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
Hello, Sam.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Just my luck.
That's right. We did.
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Tell your mother.
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Sarah.
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
She hates me, Louis.
You should go back to her.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Go to sleep.
Your back? Did you fall?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
And look what I got.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
What?
What do you mean you can see?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
How high is that?
Hey, I'm not dressed.
I know.
How come? The army?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
How?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Jake, what is it?
West.
Don't be funny.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
You know who I am.
Long time ago.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
What is wrong with you?
We're doing everything we can.
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
Why the hell we drivin' here?
What do you mean?
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Bring it in.
Alright, asshole.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Done?
Get out of here!
Thorgan, pull us in.
Let's move out!
I don't know!
And now we're all out of it.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
What if we don't?
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
I'm stuck!
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
She needs a little time.
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
He was chasing me!
GO, GO, GO!
Thank you.
You're leaving me here alone?
Later.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Sure but what good will that do?
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Where...?
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Where is he?
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
You going to be all right?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Why?
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
No, we just checked the beach...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I've got all these signs here...
Transplants?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Who's inside, you or the shark?
Fasten the pole.
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
The shaft is giving.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
Thanks for the message.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Charisma?
I miss it too.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Um, hi?
What a trip, man.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
I know enough.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Oh.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
We definitely want it to have junk.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Go learn something.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Or...
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Unfortunately, yes.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
Touche.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Share the love, Tits!
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Don't mock me.
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
You can?
Adele... are you serious?
What?
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
Early, sing me a song.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Brian.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Carrie.
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
I don't know.
With how many people?
You're clean.
Was up bitch?
Did what take?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Den less go Joe.
Why?
They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
Unzip my pack, yo.
Right.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Who?
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I know what you mean.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
Right.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Casper, where is he?
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Nothing?
No, Fidget, I...
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Because your a virgin?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Of course I do.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
No.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
No. I just gotta go find him.
What happened?
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah.
He still does.
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Hello?
Yeah.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
What are you saying?
You are!  I don't like you.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
The door was open.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
It's a voice modulator.
But a hundred men could move him.
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
Very good.  How did you know?
You don't understand.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
Why did he what?
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Of course.
Okay.
Six, eight hours tops.
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
Meaning?
We're going to work on the message.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Maybe I already have.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Then I'll transpose.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
I can check and call you back.
We'll call you back.
Yes.
Uh huh.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
No you didn't.
Of course.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
What is this?
You've got to face the things you feel.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
We're almost married.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Thank you, but I can wait.
I don't know how.
Of course it was.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
The Fortress moves?
You have not slept in two days.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
What do you see?
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
The Beast will kill her.
Use your sword.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
We must enter the swamp.
Yes. It is today.
I don't think that.
I cannot betray my bride.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
I know you.
You will follow me.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
I'm all right.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Would you settle for a boar?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
No.
I don't think it's working.
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Fewer will survive them.
I was beautiful then.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
You will come with me.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Huh... 500 meters?
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
No, you can't go out.
I never rent my gear.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
I think.
A little...
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Fine...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
...Composer.
Ten dollars... A month.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Then...
...Even his mother wouldn't.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
For a walk.  I don't know.
Here comes the resume.
You need a ride, Preacher?
Pardon?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Yes.
Go to sleep Ellen.
Is that right?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Nine.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Pulitzer, here I come.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
So I've been informed.
What Mr. Parker?
Don't do this.
Do you have a car, Steph?
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
Oh, that's not mine.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
How are you feeling?
What do you want?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
You were going to get my door.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
You do?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Sera...
Sorry.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
We?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Be careful.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Get up.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Tell him, Paulette.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Uh -- both?
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
Is she as pretty as you?
No.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
What's the point?  Look at me.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
I know. He has it sent out.
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
Thanks again for your help!
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Projecting joy is not my job.
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
I don't know --
You should. Do you have a resume?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
What, like it's that hard?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
It's not a Theta --
You're right. Phew!
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
I am afraid of nothing.
Protection?
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Do it now!
And then?
I don't expect you'd understand.
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Flozen foleva not good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
To be sure.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Don't you care about what's happened?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Knaves and robbers...
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Good plan that.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
It bodes evil.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
It doesn't matter.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
No fear of that now.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Please...
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
We wait.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
I couldn't sleep last night.
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Where's your dad?
I don't want you to!
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
What?
You'd hate him for the trick.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
It could have been a squirt gun.
A sink?
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
Thank you.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You have everything?
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
A friend of yours is here.
The gloves on the table are for you.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
You let him pierce his nose?
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
The garage.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
I smiled at him.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
Not a perfect day.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
His father is a man.
I know.
Okay.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Someone stop her!
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Better make it a week.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
I'll be right back.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Nothing.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Oooh...
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Forget it.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Say what?
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Make 'em throw strikes.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
Crop duster.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Goodnight, Ray.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Just like Elvis.
I prefer bourbon.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Absolutely not.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
What do you think about... Earth?
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
You want a queen? Got one right here.
So excited.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
You did it for Namath.
Yes, Jimmy.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
I was just playing with you.
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
You followed him?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Yes, great movie...
All right...
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
My perfume?
What was that?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Why would you be floating?
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
I love you.
Off limits.
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Anything to eat?
You're a beautiful pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Your own work?
And I did it myself right on there.
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Not in my time...
Just wondered... what happens?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
No.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
I thought I had to do something.
K.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
But what is this -- why?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
I won't.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
No, I'm okay.
What?
Yeah... Laurent.
Yeah, I remember.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Yes.
Okay. Thanks.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Did you tell the police this?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
No, sir, it's not.
He didn't come home.
Pete, what happened to you?
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Alice who?
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
I wish I knew.
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Who is this?
Yeah?...
Sorry... I...
Sheila?!
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
I do like you, Sheila.
I was?
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Yes.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Look here
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Will you stop squawking!
Please don't call me Lovey.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Over by that hill.
Leaving?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction
Goodness, no!
We follow many.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
They were.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
No.
Then it's done.
Oh, dear.
Father Perrault is dead.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
What is it, my son?
Come on! Quick! This way.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
Shhh!
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
She's going with me.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
What do you suggest?
We'd be eternally grateful if you
My name's Sondra.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Thank you.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
It's Fenner.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
I guess I lost:
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
I'd go with number three.
Kay, I'm sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Right.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
You don't know the half of it.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
There's a god damn good reason.
We're rising.
What if he's telling the truth?
I'd double it and add 20.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
You figured what?
How could it not?
It's... coming.
What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Will it lower the curve?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Why?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Because I found out about her...
Yes, you did.
You set your patients on fire!
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Kill type?
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
Uh-huh...
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Tuck in your shirt.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
I'm fine.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
No doubt.
I show a cop on horseback.
No maglev system.
Georgetown.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
You gonna tell on me?
She said...
Oh... Hi, John.
I need help with her.
She's a precog?
They don't belong to anybody.
Sean --
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
I was looking for you...
Some -- somebody's father?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
What the fuck is going on?
You're talking about the precogs...
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Do you?  Really?
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
Oh, God, what did you do?
He also said Crow was a fake.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Wait, just a second...
This murder is happening at two different times.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
Yes.
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
What?!
Yes, I know.
They're everywhere.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Jesus...
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
Is it a good room?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
What if I gave you forty?
Thank you, sir.
As far as...?
Women?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
We're in Fashion.
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
We used to take baths together.
He's not doing it.
I don't know.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I feel weird asking him.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
She'll be out in a minute.
What's that?
Where's Ricky.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Yeah. Sorry.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
No. Just the cross streets.
No. That's cool, man.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
I'm on the phone.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
What about it?
So?
Don't be shitty.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I'll page you.
Yeah. I know the number.
I know the number.
Ask if he said anything to her.
You wanna go right now?
Sorry coach.
It's not even yours.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
I'll get the girl.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Well, I don't want to walk.
Nothing else.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
I don't know.
Yeah. What vibe?
You too?
He wants to see us now.
We're getting whacked.
What about it?
No more, man.
Three and a half hours?
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Bobby and Ricky.
Fuck...
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
The videos.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
That shouldn't be a problem.
Here...
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Soho Grand, right?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
What about my keys?
But, Max --
We're square.
She poured it for --
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
And where might that be?
Who's up for a night on the town.
Bet you like that shit.
Why?
I'll give you back the 600.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, what do you want?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Then the devil is white.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
I don't know how.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Just an idle question.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
Are you?
Just hold me.
I'll be away a lot.
What do you think?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Let's cancel.
Entirely.
Allah Akbar.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
And like a fool I believe it.
The sentences to run concurrently.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Please make way, please --
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
What's your story, baby?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
I'm the man.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
It's a little late.
[Daniel.]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Who ordered it?]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[What do you mean?]
[The ransom was ten.]
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Different door. Not far from here.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Creasy...
I know. But which state?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
You feel sorry for the husband?
Don't worry. You will.
I dropped her at home.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Be a swimmer.
So are you.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
For a year?
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
[Yes.]
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
This is Mr. Creasy.
Don't forget your towel.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
That's ridiculous.
I already ate.
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Which one was that?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I feel fine.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
When was this?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
Who?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Nothing.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
So I'll die without a son.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Sure.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
What didn't you like about her?
Hey, Ang'...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hiya, Ralph...
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Waddaya talking about?!!
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Pour one for Painless.
He said it for us all, Walt.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Sixteen times.
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Be right with you.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I found a doner.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
No, no, that one.
Not necessarily.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
Hang in there.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Same here.
You think he won't.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Second pint.
Duke...
I didn't have much choice.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Sir?
Oh, get out of here!
Yes, Colonel.
I used to throw the javelin.
I out-coached that General Hammond.
Yeah?
Nice.
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Yes, sir.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You bet I will, Ma.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
There is no letter.
Plus a bonus.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
That's
Shut up!
. . . Tubby?
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
John Doe Club?
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Yes. Sure.
No.
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Flowers.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Yeah.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
Not that we know of.
You don't want to know.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
They want Walter dead!
Automatic.
Johnny who?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Earl.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
If you say so.
National Marksman Competition.
Not the ones I'm at.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
Why?
The jockey!
We lost.
You're crazy.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Which apartment?
Greg.
I've proved that, didn't I?
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Scott...
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it?
They have nothing to do with this --
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Yes.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
At least a day.
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
New York.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
And you weren't involved.
That's right.
There was no need to kill her.
Come on Tanner, think this through.
No.
What are you talking about?
Realize?
Yes.
Sorry?!
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Uplink selected.
Now tell me... what do you see?
There should be a way to open it.
What's a Triac?
Release the power with the power.
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
What do you mean "basically"?
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
But ya got a Boss.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
You scare me, Charlie.
So what happened?
No. Not everything.
What do you mean?
He's got a line on the good stuff.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
For what?
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
I'll handle the Boss.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Don, I'd be honored.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
What about the share.
I got partners.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Wanna know what I think?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Hell. It's been four days!
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
If it comes to that. Yeah.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
This is nice. I mean it.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Olive or eyeball?
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Death! Thank you!
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Uh huh. And?
Ohhh, nothing.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
I might wake up.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
He seemed quite taken with you.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
... Manly?
You mean it's dangerous?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
What! Who?
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Any time.
Okay--I mean--
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Right now--everything I own--!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Sam Foley--dead!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Now, pet--  Jim!
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
How do you feel, champ?
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Me! Jim--how--?
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
No.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
No!
Did you say--bus?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
And with your help--
Oh, just a day--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Since sixteen or so.
Have I?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Go right ahead.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Great.
Must have been tickled pink.
Wow!
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
What you *have* to do is fight!
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
That's what I said--the *truth*!
How are the pigeons?
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
And how's your bill, Senator?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
I know that.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Oh, now--that won't do--
What do you mean?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Yes--
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
Oh yes, pixilated.
Always.
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
That's all, Miss Bennett.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
I enjoy it.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Do you always wear your hair like that?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
What did you mean by that?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Yeah, I know.
No, I don't mind.
You're acting like a school girl.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Hello . . .
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Shhh!
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
Yes.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
When?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
I've got one for Cobb
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Are those stories true?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Why, it's an artistic institution
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Now wait a minute, buddy
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Christian Svenson.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
What, sir?
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
You must have been concerned.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Right now?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Good, then go.
No?
Althea hasn't told you?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
A little.
She seems very unhappy.
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
It was Henry Follett.
What do you want to know?
Doc.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Mother... go away!
What?
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Sorry... I'm done.
Be specific.
Life.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
And this is legitimate therapy?
That's one way to put it.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Of course.
Hello.
Which show was that?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
In maybe three or four issues.
Weekly or monthly?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
Uh-huh.
Do you think that's what he wants?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
He agreed?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Yep.
It's just a thought.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
It's not?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Sounds like you have several.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
Altar boys?
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
I just decked your brother
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
We're about to be shown the way.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
FINE.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Right now, I only wish to join them.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Um, well, you see...
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
I know you knew I'd know.
I'm his daughter.
Atta, boy!
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
What did he mean?
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Terrific.
Remember the cat.
Not tonight. 
What have they got that we ain't got?
What?
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
My heart died a long time ago.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
So when are we gonna have an on night?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
But I just don't feel it.
So why don't you just tell her!
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
The Eradicators!
We're superheroes.
Wow.
But... the silverware?
I use it... to fight evil.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
It is?
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Who are they?
Or both.
Right.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Cavalry?
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
And where is the army?
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
That is incredible.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Oh, shit, that's not right.
Come in.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
A glass of champagne, please.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
I see.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Junot?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
You must not act impetuously.
Well, you shall see.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Were any of them married?
Promise me.
I don't understand you.
All right -- I promise.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
What was there to tell?
God help me -- yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
We have a treaty with Austria.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Is he alone?
Send him in.
And I can go free?
Thanks, Unc.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Yup.
Not me.
Naw, I already ate.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
I don't.
I didn't see nothing.
No.
Wait for what?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Come on.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Nice to meet you?
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
What up, bro?
You damn right that's the big one.
Negative...they vamped.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Go for it.
20 minutes?
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Who, him? Just visiting.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
San Diego.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
I...
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
I have a problem.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
Who did?
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
Indeed.
For not believing you.
The gun...
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
You know what I'm gonna do.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
No! You can't! They're in on it.
On TV.
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
Is within himself.
It's a twenty.
Cover your mouth.
What?
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Laughs.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
No.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
When'll the skiff be ready?
How's your sister Pearl?
Just fine.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Yes! Yes!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
Come on!
Tricked us!
'Cause you're too little.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Hush.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Yes. Yes.
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Yonder.
What secret shall I tell?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
All right.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Naturally.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
No, Harry! I thought --
What are you after them for?
This man down at the Drugstore...
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
Now who was this?
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
You believe in anything?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
What happens if they don't do that?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Who?
What!?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
How you know that?
School.
Warm milk. Gross.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
Of course. What's that?
No more fights.
Have you any money?
What are you serving?
I have nothing to hide.
Yes.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
Positively not!
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
That's perfect!
Thank you, Louis.
What is it, my boy?
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
Razinin.
Monsieur.
That's even better.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Yes, monsieur.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
You want me to go in there?
Private.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Why should I take a chance?
On what?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
He takes good care of that.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
Is that customary?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Ni-notchka.
That is correct.
Wounded? How?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, let it ring.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
You know I want to...
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
What are you after?
Will you smile?
Because we are an odd couple.
On which boat?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Our salute will be a kiss.
But I can throw it out of the window.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Yes, sweetheart. 
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Now, Swana...
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Oh, yes.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Has done what?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Go on.
What do you want?
Why?
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
This will do. 
Can you recommend a restaurant?
How do you do, my friend.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
You did say it, sir.
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
You do it.
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
You think this is just about politics?
Jesus!  Through a window?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Sir, the deadline is today.
Can we get around this, Al?
And if I stay?
Lincoln used it.
How do you see this?
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Silence!
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
Jesus!
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
What about the documents he promised?
Yes, Mother ...
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Winning?
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
The White House.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Why?
We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
Free, if you're the president.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
That was a long time ago.
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
Yes, yes.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
Yeah ... I'm out.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I've missed you.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Someday, Dick.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
No ID in her room?
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Believe you're right.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
No sir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
How's that, Sheriff?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
Yessir.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
What do you think.
I don't know. Had dreams.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Big talk.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
I shall return.
What should I do?
You know what's goin' on?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What's that.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
No me mate.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
You know who it is.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
Sixty-nine cent.
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
I didn't put nothin' up.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
It's all right.
That's got two double beds.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
How would you describe him?
What did I say?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
I don't know. American citizens.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
I got an overcoat on.
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
You should get the order you want.
You think a woman did that?!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
No, I didn't have to.
That's a nice name for what you need...
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I'm sorry.
I'd rather not...
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
No... what about your sister?
What?
The LeSabre!
What?
Well, you are.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
No, Del.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
I have... did it sound that bad?
I got you, Del...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Make sure it's elevated...
Really?
Like Rome?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
...did I win some contest?
You're hurting him!!
Man, that is love.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
He has a wife?!
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
What? Where was he?!
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
No, almost never.
You should have a little faith in people.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Now, that's really stupid.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
Hell of a way to die.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
...among others.
Like... us?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
I'm not telling.
What?
It just didn't fit her profile...
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
What's wrong with you?
We know that...
I'll think about it.
I said I'll think about it.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Uh-huh.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
You mis'able little sneak thief...
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Do not seek the treasure!
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Latch right on to that tit.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Now Penny, stop that!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
Well that hardly sounds like you...
Isn't it, uh...
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
What for?
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I never said any of that!
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
No, sir!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Before that.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
We don't have to talk at all.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Sid, there's no baby.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
You hope.
No way... Would you?
Yeah? Why're you here?
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
I'll get it if you want.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
What's stopping you?
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
That's brilliant.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
There is not one thing funny here.
That's right.
Please...
I can't...
You got an idea?
That's their problem.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
What about us?
We'd like to come in.
No, you can't come in.
You don't look so good.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Not at all.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
People.  In the house.
What?!
Feel okay?
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
I don't know, why?
YOU HAVE TO!
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Not an option.
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Look this is bull...
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Fuck maybe... be there.
Just the legit shit.
What are you saying?
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
That would be nice, too.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
He's my father.
Do you?
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Oh?
Are you going to meet with him?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes...  ... father.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
She is.  Don't go in there.
You don't hate him.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
We saw.
Not held, just slowed down.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
For what?
Quiet.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Yaay!
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Do you believe that?
I'm sure you're not.
Well, maybe I----
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Then come on.
Ayuh.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
What?
Jesus, the road!
I just said--
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Yes, I guess I do.
I will.
Aye, aye, sir!
She.  Goes.  Free.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
I'll watch my back.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Will -- you can't trust him.
Commodore, please!
What?
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Exactly.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
And you've got that, have you?
What?  He never told me that.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You threatened Miss Swann.
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Speak.
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
Nebbleman.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Then you still love me?
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
I want Trix!  Mommy!
What did he want?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
Well, you got another problem.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Is that so?
The big house?
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
That was 'simple'?
Got it.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
No, no, I just feel wired!
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Yeah.  Old times.
Probably the caffeine.
I don't know.
Like a glove.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
The same thing I suppose.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
I have to!
Oh yeah?
It's a miracle.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Exactly.
Yes - isn't it.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
I know that.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Oh yes you will wear garters
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
I poisoned him.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
I see.
That's ridiculous.
Why
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
You're the Tribune man?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Well - it's only April.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
I beg your pardon, sir?
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Well!
I hope you'll be very happy.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Must be my wife.
Been where?
What do you know about Conrad?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Yeah?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Sorry, boss
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
I beg your pardon.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Yeah.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Yes.
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
I think it looks nice.
Bud?
It's alright.
Sure you are.
Where are you gonna go?
Oh, gosh no.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
So.
What?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
No. Of course not.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Okay--that's enough!
What do you mean!?
What are you doing?
I'm not sure.
What's going to happen?
I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
It's in your closet.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
It's okay.
The pages filled in?
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
I'm not sure.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
That's right.
My name's David.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
BUD.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
... Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Somewhere in Utah.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Why?
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I don't know.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Call me later.
You're so scared.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Nothing.
No.
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Really?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
No.
Where is she?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
No.
Hi....what....what's up....?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
I'm going to work.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Thank you.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Nothing.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Yeah.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
I'll see you later.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
Ok.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
On my knife.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Barry Egan.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
Hi Walter.
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
...I'll tell you later.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wait a minute --
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
Alright, alright.
What is this, man?
What are you doing?
Seven o'clock.
I know.
You can't just stay in your house.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Ok.
Are you sure?
Once or twice.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Not now, or we're both done for.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
By whom? The Marquis?
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
An innocent child is dead.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
Who's to say I did not?
And his writing?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
And --?
It was not inspired by circumstance.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Enough!
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Is it terribly erotic?
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
I can't
Uh-huh
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
So I've been told.
How much?
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
I will not have this in my home.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
I wanna see the picture today
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Forget it-
Showing life
Like a bug.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
We're doing Hearst.
Don't do this
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Craig is one syllable
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Yeah, you're probably right.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Happy birthday.
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
For what?
How can he embarrass you?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You want me to do what?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
C'mon, Joey.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
What?
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
You sound bitter.
Yeah. At night.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Just give it a nice little tap.
What does that mean?
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Now take your panties off.
But, Jake, I was just...
I was just...
What?
Yeah.
Jake...
I took the kids to my sister's.
What'd you see?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
What?
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Right, the gym.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Thanks.
I was jaywalking.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Who left -- where?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Ever get an answer?
You think he's getting out of here?
You sure it belongs to his wife?
Your logic is backward.
All the things I hate.
Your Lisa?
Like an old hambone?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Jeff --
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Stella!
How did you know!
Look!
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
And you love life?
Only because it's expected of her.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
For what?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
You mean "goodnight."
So do I.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Now, Lisa --
Maybe she died.
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Inside stuff?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Thank you.
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
How?
Chicken?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Jim Stark.
Okay.
Any other entrance?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
No--
No.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Sorry.
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
In my mother's drawer.
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
What?
What?
I hitched.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
They're looking for you!--
Come out come out wherever you are!
No.  I'm scared.
There's only one key.
Who?
That's a fine way to behave!
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Wash up and go home.
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
No.
But you don't think that's a solution.
Chicken?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Listen--
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Yeah--why--
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
It doesn't matter to them.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
I don't know.
You smell like baby powder.
They're killing him!
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
He hates me.
He hates me.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Please, Gabriel, don't...
To all those cons...
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Saw me --
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
Beauty and fragrances.
What the fuck is going on.
Nick, I love you --
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
Nick...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Don't say my name...
They all are. Football's on.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
No --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
What the fuck are you talking about.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
More than you know.
...never... tried...
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
No, Gabriel... no...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
He's not Nick Mason...
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Acid-chewer.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
I promise you, I didn't know!
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Thought you hate your old man.
Good for you. Protein.
GUARD!!!
...be with her...
That was my king!
Now where were we?
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
Who, Mr. White?
What about?
What for?
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Give me my book.
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Like hell I am.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
No, I'm not!
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
You don't believe in tipping?
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
What's wrong with it?
Where?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well, he knows a little about me.
He asked.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
They're stragglin'.
Thanks.
The who?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
What does a man usually tell a girl?
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
No they won't.
Like what?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
At the ranch maybe?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Finished, son?
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
You'll live.
Three men on matched roans?
What's botherin' you, anyway?
I like it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Then why stay in the hills.
There aren't any women here.
There's still tomorrow morning.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
I was doin' both. Here.
I think he wants me.
Would you die already?!
Hey, I have an idea...
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Ray, have you been here all this time?
No. I never date outside my race.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
It looks like the furnace.
Great!!!
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Let's get a hot dog.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Not in a thousand years.
Made you say it!
Yes!!!!
Alright, let's take a vote...
My child you are the only survivor.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Who?
Saw who?!
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Alright, go to the belt store...
I guess so.
What?
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Dog, you look hot.
What does it say?
"Fucked me."
Aww. Cool. Dude.
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Why?
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
You bitch!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Yes, but I lent it...
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
How much have you got?
What circumstances?
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
I can't understand it at all.
"The Dante?"
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
I don't know.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
Yes.
Devil worshippers!
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
What a peculiar question.
She was my patient.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I've lost my knack.
Uhhuh.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
You know where she is?
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
When?
Yes?
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years.
Okay, I will!!
Why is that?
Do you want me to?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Of course not.
I know.
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Yes.
Yes.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
Yes.
And now you can?
I'm babbling.
God, I m so mad at him!!
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
But you're planning to be?
I don't care.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I want out of this marriage.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
What do you mean?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
What upsets you about that?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
No, I haven't.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
What are you talking about?
No, I didn't.
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
No, it's nothing like that.
I don't want to talk about it.
Questions about sex.
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
No, but I did.
Why?
You couldn't do it, period.
About what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
How do we start?
Just a moment.
What did he say?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
No.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
When?
Nothing wrong with trying.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
I just... Ann is very...
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Who?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
A bonfire, probably.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
She held up very well.
What do you mean?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
John Millaney.
Yes?
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
He'll be really mad.
Sure.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
No. I don't think so.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Nick, you're so strange...
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
That you, Rog?
NIGHT NIGHT
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
...closed?
Indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Why?
No...couldn't I do this later?
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
Farley!
F for...
What does he know about it?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
WHAT A JOKE...
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
I'm good.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I'd rather have a knife.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh.
Want some?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Then it's a good thing.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
She works for tips!
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
We were supposed to play golf.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah. Okay.
What're you drinking?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Yeah.
Shut up.
I don't want to talk about it.
With Maya.
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
You have to tell me --
I don't have to.
Thanks.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Yeah.
Try it.
That's what I'm having.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Like what a fraud he was.
Good. So did I.
Goodnight, Miles.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
What rehearsal dinner?
Yeah.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Ken.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
I am.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
I'm pregnant.
See you over there, Miles.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Huh.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
It tastes old.
She doesn't answer me either.
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
Just make noises then.
Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.
How can you say that?
They're right behind the door.
I'm close.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
Yes.
Don't do it.
Bimboo?
Don't yell at her!
You're scaring your sister.
The footprints.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
It's like War of the Worlds.
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
All right then.  Let's go.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
That's it.
You'll never make it.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Where's Turley?
Going to Turley, was it?
I'm going to California with my brother.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
What about the law?
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
The other guy drew first.
We didn't get that far.
Who is he?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
What makes you think I could?
Did you hear his son is still around?
I just got to town.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
It is that.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
So-called?
Oh, yeah? How good?
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Okay -- for you.
-- What's wrong with that?
The public decides who's on that list.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
The picture's dead.
I can't wait to meet her.
Even the fall from the plane?
Better late than never.
You really think so?
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Impossible.
You?
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Please put your clothes on
You don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
You never were together, Hal.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
You can't.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
Not like this --
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
I know plenty of boys.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Really?  Too bad.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
-- I bet you have.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Dark?
My God, you've got one?
I don't understand.
Taller, Viktor.
You could play the lead.
What if it catches on fire?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
How do you draw now?
I don't tell her a thing.
Upset words.
No.
Me too.
I told you what I want.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Lots of things.
Anything bad about me?
A lady. She died.
Like what?
Stop it!
You're a stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
What are you talking about?
Two.. maybe three days.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Someone actually... employs you?
The band.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
I thought you said two hundred.
Manure... is life.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Not while you're driving.
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
He started it.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
I said that's enough!
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Why bother?
Sorry.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Aspirin.
And this is mine.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Shut up.
Brought you munchies.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
What can I do you for?
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Your what?
You know how rumors start.
Last year, this was a new rig.
You paying for the gas?
What do you think?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Having fun.
Driving?
You have a great profile.
Seriously?!?
Would I lie to you?
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
Yeah.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
I'm begging.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
No what?
Another time.
See.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
But I still don't think...
Twenty-one is nineteen.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
I'll believe it when I see it.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Go head on, breaker.
What's he...
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Mortal.
And threw us into the lake.
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
...About what?
I'm not doing cocaine.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
Your attitude sucks.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
They what? What? No. No. Why?
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
-- will be handled back in --
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
You got clicks, anything?
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
A million flat.
How are we on time...?
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
You love her?
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
That takes some of the sting out.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
I can trust Rheya.
Where's his body?
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Oh, that's a relief.
Dead?
Rheya.
Will she come back?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
No.
No.
Her oxygen would have run out.
I'll go with you.
Why?
Book?
You go home.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
I did too.
When?  When I'm asleep?
Was she right?
Rheya --
You're lying.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
I wish you wouldn't.
I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Occasionally.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
I'll come with you.
Sooner, the better.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
No kidding.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Absolutely.
Oh, some shit.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
What's the difference?
I'm all right.
I just sat and listened.
I heard.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
I don't really see what that has to do with...
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Take care, pal.
Remember Little League?
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
What?
Hurry up, Flash!
Hi, Adele.
Well, no.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
So you've found Thorkel?
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I left a paper in my desk.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
No
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
We did not.
Jawohl!
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Okay. Move on.
Who is it?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Forget it.
I'll call the whole pot.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Twenty-five.
It's on me.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
Some are not bad at all.
And this?
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
What's the decoy?
At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool. See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
I'll kill you for that!
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Here. Take them.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Where is he?
Then when is he going to Engineering?
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Can you project its course?
And destroy every planet in the system.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Really? What do you feel?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
What happened to you?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Where are the deflector relays?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Response?
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Aye, sir.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Not from here, no.
David... Sorry I'm late.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
None that I can detect, sir.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Sir...?
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
. He will remain always as he is.
Much is at stake...
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Go, Sulu!
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
No.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
They know we would die first.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
That's all you have to say?
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Uh -- what are they?
Say thank you.
And who am I hiding from?
Our first order of business is survival.
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
You know what she'll say...
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I am truly sorry.
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
Raise them --
No!
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Aye, sir --
Do it, while we have time.
He'll die -- !
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Uhura, patch me in --
The ship -- out of danger?
Yes, sir.
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I did not think so.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
HURRY.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
At what.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Course heading, Captain?
Honors -- hup!
He's very human.
... They do, indeed.
Please...
-- That's the general idea.
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
We're just -- observing.
I was not informed about observers.
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Name?
You play games with me and you're through
I'm wery sorry, but --
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
How soon?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
... Who are you?
I'm all ears.
... Gone?!
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
I cannot tell a lie.
Exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
Then... Where the hell are we?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Mr. Sulu?
Yes, sir.
Everyone remember where we parked.
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
You will be in good hands here.
Do you have the right to murder?
Millions?
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
There are caves in those mountains.
I'll be here.
I don't.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
For what purpose?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Why not...?
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
Won't he rust?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Are they in any danger?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
I believe it is safe, sir.
Good luck. Dougherty out.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
If it works you mean.
On screen.
Eject the core.
We're through running from these bastards.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
Why don't you try sitting up?
... I believe you...
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
I believe so.
Ready quantum torpedo.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
One minute to warp threshold...
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Yes.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
I'm very sorry.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
I can try.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Friends from Cornell...
Some.
Or...?
I have to...
That's impossible.
Aye, sir.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Understood!
Emergency override!
Wil... Data was down there.
You may need assistance, doctor...
That's the question -
No way.  You see this?
Spock's looking for us...
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
I beg your pardon?
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
But if she's cloaked...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Except us.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Candidate for what?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
LET THEM DIE.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
I SHOULD have been -
Make ourselves a target?
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
Faith...?
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
What is it?
And if they're still in place?
I believe I am.
No.
Why?
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Yes, sir.
Fire!
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Why?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
I am not.
Emergency force fields are holding.
How could I not?
Make it so.
This isn't real.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
That's an order, Commander.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
That will never happen.
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
Away team. Transporter room four.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
I've never met a human woman.
I know.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
He is what his life has made him!
But you want to.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
It is... invigorating.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
What?!
Silence, Romulan!

It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
Make any money?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
Okay...
Pancakes.
Smile... good?
Minneapolis.
No.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
I...
You want to try it?
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
I need you.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
No... The closest...
Why?
Why?
The car will stop?
Go?
Please stay.
What?
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
That was beautiful.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
Hurry up.
No. Get in.
You can have one.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Where did you learn that?
We'll get a ride in the morning.
Nothing.
I gave you a baby last night.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Fly.
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
Very beautiful country up here...
No, sir. Radar.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
Yes.
I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was a man though... right?
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
I don't understand.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
What's all this squid shit?
Hey, fuck you, man.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
No problem.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Make me forget it, baby.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
That's a good one, coming from you.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
That's not sayin' much.
Top ten.
Why me?
Looks like she was holding out.
What stuff?
Where's Faith?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Sorry.
What else you got?
What clip?  What was it?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
I always do.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Yeah, but that was for love.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Rams... that's football, right?
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So that gives you something.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
You never told me.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Yeah.
No, sir.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
That's right, Jan.
This isn't in our database?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Excuse me?
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
What's wrong with me?
Put a BOLO out on that.
What's with the eyelids?
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
This better be important.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
How long have you been downtown?
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
The other reason?
And one other thing.
What's this country coming to?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You did.
How are we going to find him?
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
Maybe you should back off.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Thomas Mackelway.
Sounds like fun.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
It's over for you.
You've been through worse.
How was it hard?
I thought I was going to die.
How?
Like what?
What what? What advantages?
Anything?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
Sorry?
Sure, that'll be fine.
No...
Six years.
Listen. I had a great time.
I'll be around.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
...well, it suits you...
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
I can call back...
Fine... I guess. You?
I thought you met someone else.
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
Unless she comes back first.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Sounds more like Aids...
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Oh, like that song...
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
Give me the money. I'll get it.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
VEGAS.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Vegas!
Whu?
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
It doesn't matter...
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
I don't know...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
No! Not the camera guy!
Hold on.
Yeah, a good friend.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
I hear she's getting real fat.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Aww... He got away?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
She didn't see.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Now?
See, baby?
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...You're just poking at it...
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...Definitely...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
We gotta move...
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
Yes.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
No, I wanted other things for you.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How?
Good.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Shhhhh.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
And when they shot me father...
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
How do you do.
Sure.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
What time do they expect us?
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
I'm thinking about it.
He'll be OK.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Send some bodyguards.
Maybe.
I do wish to be baptized.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You're unlucky.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Did you speak to my father?
Okay, darling.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Yes please!
Okay.
Say again?
You know, a primer.
Sure.
I met him in New York.
This is so good of you.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
You're breaking my ribs!
No! I've got more than one shirt!
No!
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
He's downstairs.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
How?
What evening?
Dickie?
Who is it?
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Yes it is.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Frances?
My fiance.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
I think you're right.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
That's a terrific idea.
Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
Which is?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
Where have you been since then?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
It's okay.
Or I could come back.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
What about Ripley?
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
Absolutely.
I got money.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first.  You got anything to carry these in? 
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
It keeps ya busy.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
Hello, Betsy.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Yeah.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
With who?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Oh, are you all right?
No, why?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Just follow me.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
The kind with a brush.
What did you do?
Yeah.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
One-Ball McCall?
Well... I guess so.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
What's your real name?
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Can I see you again?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You don't have to.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Damn straight.
Got your license?
Yes.
I know. I tried that.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Physical? Criminal?
Education?
Oh?
Shit.
No.  Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble.
Show it to me.
Like do anything, you know.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Well yes I suppose ...
Wait.  Where're you going?
Wrong.
The cell, Mason.
You knew?  All this time?
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
And  I love you, Pete!
Well...
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
I had it, a minute ago...
Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Yes.  Hic!
Well, there's got to be a way...
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Oh.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
And what is the state of your memory now?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Shhhhhh.
And... what's my name again?
When did I leave?
Nine and-a-half years...
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Dad, I...
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Call me... Ishmael?
She's very pretty.
We live in a theater?
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Exactly.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
It's wrong, Leo.
Luke didn't smoke.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
I can play the piano?
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
It's about me.
I thought you...
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
Where are you from originally, Annie?
San Francisco.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Different?
And what had you done?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
I don't understand.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
She already has a daughter.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
I know.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
What's the matter with them?
Why are they trying to kill people?
Is she all right?
Lois!
Morning.
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
I need her exact name, you see.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
I know, Mother.
Yes?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Shhh. Shhh.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
No, not exactly.
What good will they do?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
We know what it is, Al.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
I understand completely, sir.
Aren't these lovebirds?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Criminal.
Only violators and practical jokers.
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
Maybe.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.
No, tell me.
I'll get it.
Certainly, of birds.
Growing a beard...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Hear!
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
Well, all right, but...
I have no idea.
Do you have any lovebirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
How?
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
Then let's go. Now!
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Good morning.
Of course I will.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
But you did promise.
Pulse?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Not yet.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
I'll not do it, Gray.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
I've had some experience.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
She would if she could.
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
The strip joint?
What did they give you?
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
Have to find him first.
Erin. Who?
You know.
What did I say?
Honey. I just can't.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
You killed her!
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
That can easily be arranged.
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
What do you mean, dear?
Yes, I have!
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Why not, Bobby?
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
About 250 million of your miles.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
Thank you... Have you any news?
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I will be in just a minute.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
Looks real to me.
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Where is the meeting going to be?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
You gotta drive!
El Vampiro.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
What?
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
It was a dream, Star.
For what.
I'll hitch.
Okay.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Michael!...
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
He's already gone to bed.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
But, Mom...
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Mom!
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Well, I...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Now you and David...
Let's go see them.
Because I love you...
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
What about Mom?
I don't know.
I know.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Anybody sick?
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
I don't know who to trust.
Watch Clark.
Clark, you come on out here!!
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
Probably the next meal.
All in Norwegian.
In this weather?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
You reach anybody yet?
Move it, Palmer.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
The generator!
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Who else could have used that key?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
What?!
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
But there's nothing here.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
Created?
As slaves.
How?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
It can't all be like this...
So you take their best...
You took her because she helped me.
I know.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
I -- what are you?!
Sorry... I was distracted.
A moonstone.
Trust me...
All right...
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
Oh?
You wouldn't believe me.
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
And this is your "work"?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
So you can use it now?
I could...
May I get you some --
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
New Yorkers.
He said he traveled for two months.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I suppose so.
We don't know.
Then it's time to change that --
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Yes, sir.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
No, you're safe --
And you've no idea where he went?
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
You killed him?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
No, it hasn't.
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Our car won't start.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I might not be able to.
They're not.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
No. I don't want it to.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
Why would we do that?
Because I don't have time.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You told me this was how it happened.
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
I'm not sure.
I'll manage.
Yup. That's me.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
That when you stopped being a nurse?
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Uh-huh.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
What?
Why?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
How are things goin' out there?
You want to come on in?
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
Stop.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
That sounds nice.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
How?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Call me back.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Get the car!
Give me the keys.
You're not touchin' that car.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Will I be?
What did Darryl say?
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
She thinks he's a pig.
I won't wait up.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
You mean now or before?
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Shoot the radio!
Hit it.
What?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
We can live in a hacienda.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Yup.
What?!  What d'you think?!
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
It's grand!
You got that right.
We're fine!  How are you?
Fresno.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
What?
Well think about it.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Check.
You got a brew?
Healy, what I just tell you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
I already know it, Mary.
Some buildings I'm working on.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
She's blackmailing you, right?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Oh my.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
Bullshit!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
The prom -- you going?
You betcha!
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
What are you?
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
I agree there should be more.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
What do you mean?
Oh God.
I wasn't trying --
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
We've got bigger problems right now.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Cuba.
Yes it is.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
He was.
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
Not as far as the election goes.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
Oh, yeah -- right.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
That's right.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Let's go.
He also said "listen to the water."
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
What'd you expect to hear?
Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
Nothin'. Forget it.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
So they took care of Leo.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Never mind.
Good.
Ray. What's your 20?
Get up!
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
I saw one.
Where were you?
Apology acknowledged.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Harmless!
Anything.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
About as much as they think about killing me.
Are you really that brave?
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
What?
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
Your watch.
I was, later.
Well what?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
You're crazy. We're level.
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
Since when did you care about paperwork?
Not anymore.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
But I have to!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Any more MiGs?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Did what?
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Gotta keep track of the competition.
I've had enough...for now.
They should have warned you about that one.
Don't.
Was.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Figured out what?
Need a hint?
Just below ten thousand.
I've seen this before.
Bad?
Me?
Is that how you remember it?
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
You may not think so, but you are.
Not something they tell dependents.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Over there man.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
How'd you find me?
May I use your pen?
I am Quaid.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Hetero.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
That's right.
Any news of Quaid?
Where?
O.K., everybody pull out!
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
The door opened.  You got it.
Let's do it.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
They did!  But I killed them!
Doug...
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Right.  Mars.
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
What are you talking about?
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Why would I lie to you?
Inside what?
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
You two-faced-bastard.
Ready as we'll ever be.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
My cannon.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Well, who put you two in charge?
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
Has a lot of rain.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
I'm gonna help you.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
I want to live for the three days.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
What?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Yeah, geography.
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
And one good guy.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
The hell you do. At this hour?
"We"?
What about entrapment?
Not necessarily...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
We had a description of the suspect.
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
What other case?
Eddie... I don't know about this...
-- Yeah?
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
"No," what?
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Shu Kai Kim.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Badgering.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
-- Every word.
-- What trial?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
And you b-believe that.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
Get lost Bobby.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Thank you, Carl.
God damn, you people are confusing.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Oh.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Okay, Gordon!!!
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
ALBERT?
He didn't suffer.
No.
No.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
It must be a high priority situation.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
I think that's a good idea.
I'll get my kit.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
You didn't do your homework?
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
No, I want to smoke.
No, you're the muffin.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
But I love you, Laura.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Did you make me a tape?
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
We were supposed to be together.
I can't tonight.
When he finds out.
What?
Boating?
You're getting warmer.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Mom, take it easy.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Stay away from me.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
The man's an ambulance chaser...
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
How did you settle on the amount?
Yes.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
You know what that would mean?
No.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No, you did fine.
I. Yes. It is.
Yes? Galvin, right?
Yes.
Why?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
You live in the neighborhood?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Why is that?
Thank you for seeing me.
And are they going to get it?
You're going to stay here...?
You, you don't under...
No.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
From the magazine?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Admittance form is wrong.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
You got a good memory, Franky.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
She did?
...of the procedures...
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Huh. And why is that?
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
All right - I've seen enough!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Like...ah...
Would you like some coffee, General?
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
D.O. to number three..come in.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Welcome to California!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
What?
Guess so.
What?
Finish, please!
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
When do you think it'll be done?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
You really think Dylan's okay?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
Then what is he doing?
That was Nancy, not me!
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Uh...sure...when?
Me too.
You miss him.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Guilty.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Good.  Let's go sailing.
How old are you, son?
Gieg, Chuck.
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
You're not a moron.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
What was that?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
That's not why he's sending me.
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
Yes.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Fine.
Ya know... "It".
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
What are you talking about.
Speak up boy!
All stop on the engine.
I don't know.
No.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
Why are you here?
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
Why would you do that?
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
It hurts too much to care.
You've gotta be kidding?
Son of a bitch!!
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Y'all take American Express?
Twenty.
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Sorry to hear it.
No.
You an indian?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Used to.
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
Set one up.
Muchas gracias.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
Come here.
I'm sorry.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
And?
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
What happened to him?
What's that, peanut?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
We got through two states already.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
What was this one?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Who do?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
They have, sugar.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Sailor?
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
I'll come along.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
That was in Vietnam.
Shake hands with your daddy.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
What makes sense, is all.
Like hell.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Yes.
Through the forehead?
Yes.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Someone's gonna see us.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
I didn't see nothin'...
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
You're welcome.
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
She's still a transvestite.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
He lives with his mother.
Tripp, where the hell...
Don't touch it.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Call it a hunch.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
I peeked.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Right.
You?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
What's he saying?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
So where have you been staying?
But James. I mean... How long?
I don't know...  Me.
No.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
No thanks.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Jesus.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Really, Sara, I...
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I think I might have.
I told Walter.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Her husband.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Foreman now.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
It's a nice table.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What's that?
Next week? The week after?
That was terrific.
I'm not pretty.
I have no idea.
Why don't you just tell me?
Got something to hide?
Who said I wanted to buy it?
Okay.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
Yes.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
No thank you.
I can't.
Yes you can, Robin.
What will happen if I do?
Will I see you again?
I said the job is okay.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
It's all the same.
That's right.
Why not?
I don't understand.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Then think about it.
I'm still thinking about it.
It's okay.
I don't feel anything.
What are you afraid will happen?
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
How do they know?
What is your idea of being normal?
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Sorry.
Where are you?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
All right.
Are you okay?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
You must hate it.
What about them?
You're damaged.
Yeah?
Maybe later.
It's not what you think.
You really believe that?
What?
Most people say the odds are against me.
Move in with me.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
I'm taking you back out.
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
No.
But what did he see that made him panic?
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
No.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
It's trying to communicate.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Who then?
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Everything is.
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
I can't... make it... podner.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Copy that.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
How deep?
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
You already know what they are.
At what?
How should I be ... arrogant?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Okay. In a few minutes.
Why?
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
But then why did you bother changing?
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
What is it?
Ask her.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
And where do you find the models?
And do you remember where she got off?
Thank you.
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
And how come you're up so early?
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Of God.
Yes Mother.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know... I don't know...
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Uh huh.
Do you think he loves you?
At least once a week.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
I went to my room.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
No questions.
What things?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
How did she know that?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Agnes...
She can.
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Doctor Livingston.
Because I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
Of what?
No.
Why?
It grew.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Someone's following me.
A wastepaper basket.
Of what?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Why?
She'd seen him too.
Yes.
Agnes who did you see?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Yes.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Do you still go to church?
No-one.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
And in your eyes?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
And what happened?
About two years before.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
What sheets?
And Agnes' father?
Because I didn't know... 
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Pipe!
Mary Magdelen?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
No.
Of course.
For Agnes.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
The father!
I'm concerned about her health.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Is it because she's a nun?
Too late for what?
And the baby.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
Yeah.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Yeah.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Spoil sport!
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
He comes from a large family.
I'll look in here again.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
What are they saying?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Hiding.
I think you're soft or something.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
No.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
Come on speedy!
I would though.
You are.
Oh you do, look.
Oh, leave off!!!
He'll get over it.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
What?
Shurrup, cheerful.
Hell, we're equipped --
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Dell, plot our location.
Is it solid?
A transmission?
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Has the hull been breached?
Yeah!
What?
It grows on you.
That way.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
How do we locate the creature?
At least it can't get up here now.
It's time for drastic remedies.
Good!  That's good!
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
We can use the flamethrower.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Engine room, what happened?
Found what?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Food-storage room!
You win.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
Yeah... I forgot.
What did it do to you?
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
What can I do?
Sure.
I told you we... what's that?
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Not yet.
Do it.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Yeah, I got it.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Yeah, I...
It's alright, it's cool...
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Uh-huh.
Done it already.  Nothing matches.
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Real man' drink.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
What can I do?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
... and Karen.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
And too many of them are produced.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
When I'm guest of honor?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Twenty minutes!
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
Okay. Mix.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Here we go...
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
You were great.
Yes, dear.
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Every day.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Of course not.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
I'm for it.
You're quite a girl.
You think?
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
But she just got here...
What did you expect - live sables?
I never played Fort Sumter.
Of course!
Why not?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
I've heard of them.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
Not at all.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
I'd like that.
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
- an understudy's performance.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Thank you, Karen.
The curtains. I made them myself.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Of course.
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
I detest cheap sentiment.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
Well... all right.
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
Where is she?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Anything to help you out, Max.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
I was sure trying.
We need a sympathetic face.
And?--And?--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--Haldeman I know, who else?
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
11:30.
Oh.
--Teddy Kennedy?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--there's nothing new in it--
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Absolutely--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Just let me get a match.
...No... never in so many words...
Which people?
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
I don't know titles.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Mitchell knew then.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Just go!
Why is this?
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
I think I've had one.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Did you guys hook up or something?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
Pontificated.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
I told you.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
She's a mermaid, dude.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
For me?
Okay, don't stop.
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Yeah.
I love you.
Yeah.
What?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Uh huh.
Would you shut up?
But you better hurry.
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
What?
Serafine...?
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
Well, they are French.
You'll never get the chance.
What?!
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
You fucking liar!
Merde.
I was showing Sonya something . . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Poor Meetoo!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
Sad?
I'm sorry.
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
Is it? Is this what you want?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
What do you mean?
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
M'mm.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Yeah? Allison what?
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Get him!
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Oh - you're an actress.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Oh.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Really?
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
As Balzac said...
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
No.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah?
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
That's the key question.
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
M'm.
M'hm.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
Oh.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
No.
Very big spider.
Yeah?
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Check it out.
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
I thought just earplugs.
Why are you so hostile?
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Are you?
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
Hey.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
You all right?
How about a ginger ale?
V.P.L.?
We're gonna operate together.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
But she's colored.
We really had a good time.
You think so? Do you really?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
It has your ring.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
Leo?
Didn't I say?
Just don't fucking tell her.
It's not going to come up.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
Don't you miss it?
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
You really need to be fucked.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
I adore him.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You can never be too early or too thin.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
She left the fucking gate open.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Otis!
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Anyone else?
He's my favorite.
Oh, Sally Mae...
Come on, Panes...
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
No.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
No you're not.
Hm.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Lemon it is.
Come here.
I like you.
Not good.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Not at all.
Do you need anything else?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
If he were still alive, maybe.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
You see, that's worse.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Like the last time.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?
You don't need to thank me.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Like Joe.
So where should I put it?
A notch above the storage room.
So how much do you hate her?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
I trust you.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Not nice.  Not kind.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Right...because every ant's important!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You -- you think I'm right?
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
No...as a matter of fact...
Quiet -- sshhh!!
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Hlllllllp!
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Of course not --
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Outstanding.  Princess...?
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
ONE TO NOTHING!
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Oh, I understand.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
What's her first name?
Your stomach?
Thanks for reminding me.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
I'm sure that's the explanation.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Gin.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Thank you.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
You did?
Here.
In the knee?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I'm fine all over.
In there.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Last night?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Gas?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
You better.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
Well -- I guess so.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
I see.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Now hold on, Baxter --
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
Fran been sick or something?
Mr. Sheldrake?
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
You threatening me?
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
Aren't you?
Sure, Doc.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
No.
Kubelik.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Let me take that.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
Handle what?
I love you -- remember?
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
Lovely. You were a big help.
It won't happen again.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Yeah --
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
Get out --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Why they call you that?
I don't know.
Who's he?
God knows.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
... he's an amazing officer.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
Where ?
I'll go with him --
Looks pretty shallow.
I never heard about that.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Anyone got a cigarette.
Ours.
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
Charlie?
They must have seen the fire.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
Six to eight feet.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
I was on threshold of great things.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
What?
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
You think he'd of shot us?
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Right now -- I am.
Needs patching.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
Your infrared camera?
28   CONTINUED:
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
It's exactly what you meant.
Wait a second.
I'm staying.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
That makes the flight more interesting.
Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together.
You got one?
It was blown up with the plane.
No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-
Shut up!

The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
What are you talking about?
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
I love you.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Me. My home number is on this card.
I've got Jews at my table.
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
I see the help -- judgement call.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
Spence.
How old are you?
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
No!!! Stay away from me!
Just how grateful I am.
Thank you.
No, sir...
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
I can trust my brain.
Okay. Good-bye.
What job?
I had to see you...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
You know what? I...
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
About a dog.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Sure thing.
What?
'Love was... '
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Verdell?
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Oh, my gosh.
Does it matter?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
What?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
You can't --
Okay, don't.
I ain't scared of you.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
Yes, sir.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
An assassin?
Yes.
We don't have a choice.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
No.  Just Electra.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why not?
Why not?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Why?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
Good.
Mexico.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
We split the money?
What happened?
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
Nobody ever sees me.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
I'm sure you will.
Am I attractive?
Attraction is a complication?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Why not?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Right.
That's correct.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.
No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
And put it on expenses?
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
'cause you stink of booze.
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
Am I late?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Both, see you later.
Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine.  Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
And if you're wrong.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Sure I'm sure!
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
That's my mum's.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I think he's jealous of Havel.
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Fernet and tonic.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
What's the Bugler?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
Sure!
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Cool!
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Yeah.
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
With you.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
No. I won't be long.
I could take after Dad, too.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Now it's okay?
It was.
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
-- Your act only works with an audience.
No. Not like you.
It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
Don't bother!
No.
Yes. And?
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
I heard what you did. Thank you.
What?
I wanted this to be a date.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Away from here.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
You planned this --
Hoped for it.
What about your father?
Me.
Sure.
That I want you to take me home.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Lead man.
How -- how long does she have?
I thought she built it herself.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Yeah.
Where's your old man?
Yeah. Maybe so.
But he didn't ask me.
Well... yeah...
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Five cents, please.
Shhhhhhhh!
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
The power converter...
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
What did you do to your hair?
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Thanks.
What'd you come out here for?
Yeah.
You love him?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Doing what?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Sure.
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah?
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
But it would hurt.
Why?
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well, he didn't have it last night.
Yes?
Just thinking.
Yes.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
Planet 10?
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Let her out. In my custody.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
What? How do you know that?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
No, I don't.
Which?  The one in my throat.
She was killed, Penny.
I have a radio fix...
John Whorfin will kill us!
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Pictures don't lie.
Asshole probably got lost.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Ever act?
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
To see pap.
Go ahead, son.
Well, you just... sound a little
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
What do I write about?
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
And I could tell you some stories 
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
That's all right, really 
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
You're leaving?
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
You gotta believe me 
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Physician, heal thyself.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Yes.
No, Nick, please --
Nilsen.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
What was she like in school?
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
No.  Come in.
No, thanks.
There's a name from the past.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
No.
To see if I can get away with it.
I know.
No?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
I'm writing a book.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Cocaine.
Routine.
Nilsen?
What is it you got between you?
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I went over last night, too.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
I don't believe it.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
Catherine told me what was in it.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
On what basis?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Yes I did.
I'm a painter, too.
Let's get out of here.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
Sure.
I can get ten.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Yeah.
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Who am I?
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Come on in!
I ain't John Henry.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Can I walk you home?
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
It's Monday morning.
Basquiat, what did you take?
A present I picked up for you.
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
I'll take the whole tin.
Wanna Mac?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
My point exactly.
So shut up and keep painting..
A what?
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
"Shreck's."  You --
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Oh.  "Kyle."
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Nope, I told her everything.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Sure.
What're you doing three dates from now?
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
... eight, seven...
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
I don't.  So, no.
Too good?
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
Right here, sir.
What are you talking about?
Divide and conquer.
Why?
I'm afraid to ask.
Be ready for anything.
What exactly are you doing?
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
What are you talking about?
She knows who we are.
You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
I've got to stop him.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Don't be ridiculous.
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Perhaps the fall...
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Al?
Just checking, young sir.
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Just ones this beautiful.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Exactly.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
But...
What?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Touchy, touchy.
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
How could I forget?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
I don't think so.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Don't bogart that 'trode.
About what?
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
WHAT?
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
I've considered that possibility.
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Holy shit...
Allie, he's not.
He's not crazy.
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
I said I'd check with you.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
Meaning?
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Howls he getting on with the family?
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
Ahm....
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
A car sounds sensible.
Well, there is that ...
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Okay.....
And Boot-Head.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Me first! Me first!
Forget it, bunghole!
Yeah, really.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
I see it. I don't get it.
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
Not now Bork.
Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
That's how long you were gone.
... Hmmm?
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Where are your skulls and bones?
I didn't --
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Well, we didn't know --
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
Yes.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
You've got to help them.
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Why not?
Delia hates it.
... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Any particular kind?
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
I saw some ghosts.
It wasn't a joke.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
I'm sorry already.
Oh, as long as we're here...
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
... But he's...?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Oh, yes.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
I agree.
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Hello, Eve.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
He does...?
That's good.
Yes. I was.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Oh, I like that very much.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Hello, Dennis.
To watch...? To watch me...?
That's very interesting, Eve.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
I don't want Robert.
I agree.
So you know Krylov!
Yes, it is very good!
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
I understand.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
I see.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes. It is.
Yes.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
You're welcome.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Yes, I understand.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
Do you feel well enough for that?
It's not that, I just...
Look, Johanna...
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
Right, Chief.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
I'm afraid so.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah.
Who am I thinking of?
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Seven-ish
Just an idea I had.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Right.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
Fuck Maxine.
We wish.
What's that?
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
The iguana?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Yex?
No.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Yeah. But enough about me.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Hello. Wendy.
Ha ha ha!
Hush, sweetheart.
I like that.
Why are you being like this?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Do you?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
When?
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Is there dancing?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
You've got to be kidding.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Here, let me carry that.
Well what?
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Don't pay to complain.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Ella.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
What run him off? Tell me that!
Never found out.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Uh-huh.
The Gundersons.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
My rug.
And this guy peed on it.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Are you gonna split hairs?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
I'm not really, uh.
Please!  Please!
Far out.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
She most certainly was not!
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
From who?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Maude?
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
What?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh?
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
Thanks Walter.
Dude--
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Not exactly a lightweight.
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
It is a fucking emergency.
Yeah?
Come on, Walter!.
Wha. . . Donny--
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Huh?
Help me put him back in his chair.
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
Impressive.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
I wouldn't worry about it.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
So?
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
He was here.  Watching us.
Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
You're wrong.
Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Preventive medicine.
Like me.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Blade --
No --
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Deacon brought me back.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
You've been listening in the whole time?
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
What do you mean?
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Inside the grave?
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
I guess--
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--Christ almighty--
Think again.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
That's a joke?
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
I don't know.
I don't know. Nightmare.
--bullshit!
What'd you dream?
Why?
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Yeah?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
--I don't know.
--I saw what I saw.
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
No one ever comes here.
Anna's the witch.
--turn the goddamn camera off!
Fine.
--now there.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
Asleep--
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Spite.
All I need--
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
You planning on sleeping out there?
She's off her fucking rocker--
You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
Anna--
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
What happened to my Dad??
Abby...
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
See a guy.
...Huh?
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
What the hell happened, Ray?
Thanks.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
What night is it?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Well now you do.
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
How long did you watch her?
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
So it would seem.
Of course.
Pour that back.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
You shouldn't have taken the money...
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Yes?
The criminals are winning.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
THEN WHAT?
I'll go then.
Yes.
Yes, I like you.
What?
Don't say that.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
That's good.
Are you a bad boy?
You look beautiful to me.
Go where?
On a ride.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
Okay Frank.
Am I bothering you?
What else is new?. right?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Just a minute.
Go ahead!
No Jeffrey!!
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Well.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
That sounds great!
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
You can change it if you want to.
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
You're a fucking amateur!
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
You?
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
What kind of project?
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
I would if I could get some sleep.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
This is not the time, Diego.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
You fucked me, Diego.
Cocaine?  How much?
Barbara.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
Un sapo?
Yes, it is.
It's beautiful.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
And Diego?
Yeah, well...
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
I'm sorry, George.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Hello.
Why are you smiling?
I said, I've seen it before.
Alright.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Is she here?  Is she coming?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
I know, Dad.  I know...
Shhhh.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Because she's visiting me.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Stoned?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
Don't be such a pussy.
No. It has failed in its objective.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Exactly.
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Second district ... Explain better ...
What "group"?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Don't move, Hacene.
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
Not enough.
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
But it's not even midnight yet!
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
No -- never.
What about Miss Lawson?
What did Mr. Marsh say?
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
For about one year.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
Thank you.  The State rests.
Yes -- several times.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
No.
You called him?
No.
What did you prescribe for her?
Yes -- quite easy.
No.
How?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
I suppose.
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
He video taped you.
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
Yes.
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
No further questions.
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
Hi.  It's Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Really?
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Because I'm expecting a call.
How often do you use cocaine?
You better.  Please answer the question.
I am relaxing.
Some example you set.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Talk to me.
Why didn't you come to me?
It's more involved than that.
Why are there two deeds here?
I know. I don't understand it either.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Yes. Very clean.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
We got engaged.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Why do you say that?
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
Uh-huh. And?
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Am I too heavy for you?
For who?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
What's her name?
Cremated?!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Hell no!
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Damned if I know.
Climb out to where?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Hush, baby.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
You know I can't.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
All the more reason I should be here.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
How do you know?
Why?
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
And you believe her?
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Here!
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Evidence of what?
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
Admit what?
Where's what?
I can't.  I can't.
Give it to me.
All part of the business.
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
There's no time.
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
What happened to them?
Don't tell him --
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Another time.
Hey, Mickey.
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Oh, really.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Five years is a long time.
I don't understand - ?
What you heard wasn't sex.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Do you think you know me like that?
I think ...
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Does the case lock?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Sweet Jesus.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Fine.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Pop?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
We don't know what we're into!
Treadstone?
...which one are you?...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
That's all I get?
Jason...  They can't let you go...
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Sir, you waited on line.
Yes, I'm here...
Really.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
What does that mean?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
-- you could put it together --
I was shot twice in the back.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
-- just --
We have to keep moving.

Think I could rent a scooter?
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
xxxxxx
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
No.
...aven't you?
... get to it.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
You must save the day.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Her name is Jill.
Beginner's luck.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Layton! Oh shit!
You killed him?
He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
Tell me about Layton.
A terrorist?
So what are you going to do about her?
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Yes.
Is it stamped?
It's my fucking life.
Why not?
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
You're joking.
What?
Are you still following me?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
No you're not!
Your face ... are you hurt?
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
It's not our mistake!
The refund for Tuttle!
Try next of kin.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
What?
I'm sorry but ...
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
What is it?
Mother!
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Actually, I've decided ...
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Fixed itself.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
Ha!!
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
What if there is no tomorrow?
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
Stressed? He's psycho.
She asked me to pick her up.
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Sure.
He'll be all right.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
Come on up.
I think the worst is over.
You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
She's no whore, Marcus.
Backup?
Greatest job in the world.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
What do you think?
The family know?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
A medical miracle.
Crazy fucker.
He was tough. You did all you could.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Frank!
You know what. The radio.
You sure?
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
I don't think so.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Which would you prefer?
Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
Not because you have to.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Yes.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
No.
I lost six pounds...
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
No.  You know that I'm not.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Yes.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Upper management thinks you're dull.
So I quit.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
Yes.
We could...
How do I get out of here?
Oh.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
You don't have to finish tonight.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Yes.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Yeah?
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
I knew what you meant.
You want to come?
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Yeah.
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
Of course...it's wonderful.
Now you're a professional!
You think I'm creative?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Hm.
I'm honored to know this man.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
What are you doing here so early?
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
Not only that, he copied us!
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Let's check out the scene.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Huh?
Enough already about it - get to work!
Well...
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
You didn't mean to what?
Well, w-what did you do?
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Huh?!!!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Call me...Maxwell.
What do you get?
Then let me give you something then...
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Would you sleep with them?
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Eeyuu.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I think you've forgotten something.
I am so sure.
You guys are thrashed.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Mmkay.
Dress, huh?  What for?
What for?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Pretty shallow of you.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Get away from me!
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Am I in trouble or something?
Why?
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
None of your business.  God.
She --
Skip it.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Uh... gym.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
My nails.
Fine.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Buffy...
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
I guess.
My parents have money...
Hi, Grueller.
You think so?
Jeffrey!
No --
Okay.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Okay.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
What?
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Nuke?!
No.
How 'bout a back rub?
He did?
I'll be back when we lose.
it's okay..
You don't have to...
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
But you were pulling your hips last night.
You got me all confused.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
It's possible.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Don't think.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Gimme that.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Boring.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Why am I a fuck?
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Take the first shot at me.
I ain't hitting a man first.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Don't try me.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
She's playing with my mind.
It's a miracle.
Well, I'd rather not say.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were wandering around.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Hold on a second.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Help, Daddy!
Matter of fact...
How did Nicky collect?
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
What?
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
What happened to me? What happened to you?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
I just told you. She called me.
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Oh, thank you, sir.
No, that's quite all right.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
You bet.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
I'll come by.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
Half - I'm comin' down. 
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
Call security.
Thanks a lot.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
I'm not crying. 
Yeah.
Right?
You sure?
Okay.
It's nice isn't it?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Why do you need that much?
You're not takin' Amy.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
A record of the arrests...
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
No.
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Thank you.
Mm.
Yeah, thanks.
You shut up.
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
You can't talk to me like...
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
I can't.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Is that the last one?
Carmine's gone.
I'm over here now.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Artie! Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
How are you?
I know.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
I'll be right out.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Want me to take this for you? 
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Am I right?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I know what you mean.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Yeah.  Thanks.
It's all right.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Yeah?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
You did. You're right.
Sure did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Nicky, please...
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Yes.
You are.
Promise?
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
Yes, don't worry.
Get up.
Get up.
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
This peter's a motherfucker.
Every night, on the couch.
Hey, Shelly. 
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Are you sure?
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Pass!
Even the skylight?
Why am I still troubled...
Absolutely.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
You think so?...Selina?
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Enough.
Uh-huh..
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
You gotta just look the other way.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
Shit!
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Another minute.
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
How much time do you have left on it?
Our house always needs touching up.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What bank?
Not a chance.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
No.
You're all three of you in that van?
Can you walk?
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Assure them that you're being well treated.
What's that supposed to me?
You, I would've noticed.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
How about "later?"
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
That's not good enough.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
What time frame have you got in mind?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
We don't see you.
I still don't see you.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Negative.
And then?
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Put the girl on.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Better reassure him.
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
The fuck I will!
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Are you busting my chops or what?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
There's no lady here.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
She's not a girl, Col --
Did he?
Hi, Jimmy.
An excellent quality.
Saw it, Dil.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Who the fuck is he?
It's him, isn't it?
Cunt.
Please, Dil --
He wants to know do I mean that.
What?
Bloody right I do...
How'd you guess?
Who's she?
Shouldn't I go?
Maybe.
Depends what it is.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Where?
What you doing here?
Apologies, my sweet.
Probably.
Absolutely.
I'm working on it.
Delirious.
So I got it wrong, then.
Don't.
You following me?
She from Scotland too?
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
And you wouldn't leave me?
You promise?
Yes.
For you...
What condition?
I suppose I tried.
Got to be somewhere.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Not if you go.
You will, Dil
I promise.
Meet Col --
Carnations.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
I heard.
Suits you.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
You sure?
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Why?
You sure about that?
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
I thought it was Dave.
Should blow you away, you know that?
A hotel?
Am I?
Why can't we?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
She's not my type.
What?
What?
Tree.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Do you?
You liked her?
Don't think that way.
Take her picture. C'mere.
I told you not to talk that way --
What?
You won't run.
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
You shut your face --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
It's lovely.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
We? You mean you're --?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Describe him.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Carson?
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
That's the idea.
Then who does?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
It's all right with us --
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Maybe.
Maybe.
What's so illogical about that?
Alex --
I'm scared.
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Yes.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
In money.
But his mother --
He didn't have one.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Now you're angry.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Starting tonight?
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
On the street where you live.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Good night.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Don't put yourself out.
I don't understa--
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
Don't you want me to stay?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Why?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Calm down Brent.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
I will. Is that all?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Not much further.
You never went, uh, all the way?
Who is she Daddy?
What did you hear?
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
You think you're my sister?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I was desperate. It was gross.
No!
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Twenty eight years ago.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
I'm making you feel like meat?
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Yes?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Not that I know of.
What?
Two men left town right after it happened.
You're not telling me something.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
And she didn't?
Now don't be nervous.
Ok.
I'm not leaving it here.
Okay, okay.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
Oh...
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Uh, huh?
Except for the fact that I need cash.
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
...ya?
For cryin' out loud.
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...-er.
I need your truck!
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog ain't mean.
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...

Oh, man.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
...fine.
Shut up.
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!

Oh...
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...-er!
...you.
...Shift.
...we can make it.
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
That's right.  Now,  move!
Goddamn!
Get over!  Get over!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on, old...
Come on.


Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
Come on.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
Okay.

He's crazy!

Oh, no!

 All right.  Hey.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
You know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, if that gun was...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
That is loud!  I'm 
A-And you  owe me...
Bring him down!
...-natic.
...on!

I'm gonna kill him.

 There's gotta be...
Hold this. 

We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Stop limpin' around like that.
You.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
No.
This country trained me to kill...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
...-bility.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
...I wish they would've let me say something...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Pleasant surprise.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
I'll do it.
EXT. FORT LEAVENWORTH - TEN YEARS LATER - DAY.
INT. LONG'S CAR - NIGHT.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY
 But...
It's a hundred degrees...
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
Like I say, Doc Long's...
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.

Dead, last time I...

...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
EXT. DAM - DAY.
...tight!

I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
...-son.
Run a check.  FBI, Interpol.
Been trying to figure out your secret.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
Some people might.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
You find yourself wearing a...
...public drunkenness....
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
 Talk to me.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
'Course you do, Jake.
An honest living.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
Probably.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
His girlfriend?
My daughter.
What is it?
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
What are you talking about?
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Oh they don't?
Where's that?
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
Well you own a lot of land.
The apple core?
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How are you, Lou?
When I do, you'll hear about it.
I don't.
Let me show you something.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
They only dump the water at night.
No.
A complete surprise?
Mr. Gittes.
I don't want to drop it.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
...Just a minute...
She's cheating on him.
No, not for that one.
I don't believe you.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
I know.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Katherine.
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
I said, the northwest valley.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Mr. Gittes...
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yes. No.
How did they get it away from him?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They were partners.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
You don't say?
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Then why don't you change jobs? 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers."
That's a long story.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
I'm going back there.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
That looks pretty nice.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
It isn't finished?
That's Leland, isn't it?
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
It may not be about anything at all.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
No.  They've passed on.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
They do it only because you do!
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
I'd like to talk to you about that.
I'm drunk.
I'll get you some coffee.
Why, Brad?
You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
Are you finished?
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
Yes.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
Yes and no.
Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
How long have you been a smoker?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
He went home to change for the big date.
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
I can't believe you're here.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You lie.
Look how full of yourself you are.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
You're serious. You want to date again.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
You have a better suggestion?
Sang.
It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Was it you?
No.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
With this guy locked in?
In a second!
I'll assess all I want!
I can whip your ass.
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
So I'm told.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
What smells like shoe polish?
Did you tell Veronica?
What about Veronica?
I think it's safe to say yes.
Blasphemy.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
She's in here?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Can we talk about this later?
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
Why not?
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I don't want to talk to you.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
Exactly.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
And this is what you rented?
I like to expand my horizons.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
I should shit or get off the pot.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Thanks.
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Thirty-fire.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
How do you know that?
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
You calling me a liar?
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Ooh! Can we?!
And I actually date you?
Twelve.
Including you; yes.
You're a pig.
Three.
Where?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Why do you say that?
Yeah, right.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
I don't want to go back with her...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
What's this?
I didn't do that!
Scumbag. What are you doing?
No way.
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
Because he's out of shape.
No, I wasn't.
I hope it feels good.
You hope what feels good?
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Like hell you are!
No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
Bye  That was Snowball.
How yo doin', Gabe!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device.  Step into my office.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Hi, Gabe.
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
We spent a night there one night...
Enough.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I don't think you do.
Did I miss something?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
What are you doing here!?
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Call me sentimental.
It was great.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
Helluva time for vanity!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
There.  You blind?
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
Then it's a deal.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Good morning, Walt.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Good evening.
Try the wine!
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Won't you join me, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Who are they, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
It's alright, thank you.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
Where is he now, sir?
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
You mean like going to the pictures?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Just part of hospital routine.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
How many did I get right?
And when do I get out of here then?
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
What?
Sixth is faster.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Of course.
Sorry?
What?  What did you say?
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
You guys been holding hands?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.
Who the hell is this?
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
You on some kind of work plan?
Two, two-fifty.
You always stutter?
I'm cool.
Okay, try it now.
What?
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
How?
Believe it.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I'm not catching a melody.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
I'm done.  Find another cab.
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
What's at Union Station?
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
Who?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
Motive?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Switch the charts.
Love.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
This would be it?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Has this happened to you before?
Who are you, Jerry?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
How is it possible?
Please put it down.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
Thanks.
Back where?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
You do?
You knew just what I was there for.
I don't know...
And you have no idea where he lives?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
The truth shall make you free.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
You sound so sure.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Night after that?
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
This doesn't make sense.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
Anything happening in there, El?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Ellie...
You can't just pull the plug, David.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
With me.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
You mean --
Ellie.
What?
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Ellie.  Pulsar?
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
By our standards... yes.
Many others.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
Now... you go home.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
I didn't realize I was out.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
That's what they all say.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Greenbank?
You sonofabitch.
How long was I gone?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
But --
In other words.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Recommendations?
Have your department make a full report.
Git your shovel and git to work.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
That's good: he earned it.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Well, whatta we got here?
I just always did like truck rides.
You tryin' to say somethin'?
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Oh mah baby Luke.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Cuter again.
Damn.
No. No chains either.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But </u>alive</u>!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
I thought he was lying.
I was?  How you spell that?
You get me out first.
You already made the delivery?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Would you want to work with us on this?
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
Then what do you need me for?
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
I'll get a locksmith.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
I know, baby.  I know.
What else?
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
Honest to God, Ruben!
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
What the hell you need her for?
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
One of my suitors.
Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I can drive.
Yes.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I did this already.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
And the party?
Really?
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
I ruined your wedding night.
I know.    I know.
Will you get time off to do that?
Mom, please.
Tomorrow?
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
Mom, please.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
I'm glad.
Terrific.
By color.
Anything interesting.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
No rounds for another three hours.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
What are the delusions like?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Break up?    They wish.
Tell the doctor.
Lie down.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
But I do.     I love you, too.
Not a one.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Promise?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
You should go.
She's only known the guy a few months.
Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
Yes, I suppose so.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
So, I've been thinking a lot...
So will you?
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
That's a load off my mind.
It doesn't matter who.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
I start on Monday.
Michael.   Yes.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.
You're there now?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Oui.
Take what you've got and get out of there.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I'm not any closer than you are.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
What for?
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
Good idea.
No?
I will.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
What?
I just thought that--
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Yeah, French guys from France.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Go where?   The police are outside.
I see.   A master criminal.
This kind.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
We've got to get out of here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
No.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
I know where she went.
What?
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
Take a nap.
They're not nice people.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Okay.    Okay.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
I'll go and make up his room!
And if I use them to kill you?
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I owe you nothing.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You're probably right.
No, really?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
I'll give them to you.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Come and get it if you can.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Kneel!
Never!
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
You coward!
Yes.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
What does it say?
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
I don't know...
What do you have in mind?
I'm buying.
No onions?
They make you fart.
Don't thank me.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
No.  I have one more thing to do.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Elly...
She's still dead.
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
Wrong answer.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I'm already alone.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
That's right.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
No.
Why not?
You did?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I sincerely doubt it.
Shut up.
Because you act like a pig.
No thank you.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Yes.
Reading.
Not at all. Have a seat.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Yes.
Where are you going?
I think that's for the best.
What are you saying?
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
I'm sorry about that.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
I don't think that bothered him.
Are you shitting me?
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
That's great.
Eyes closed.
You'd do that for me?
It's Kathryn.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
He made you give him a blow job.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
You think he'll like it?
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
I swear.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
You do?
Good luck, Sebastian.
Who told you?
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Yes!
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I'll be right there.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
What?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Interesting.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
But who will they turn to for help?
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Have you succeeded in your task?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
Where is she?
It clearly is why.
I'll do my best.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Annette! Annette!
It's really important.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Did she show up?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
All right, mommy.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Yes, I did.
Certain wishes do.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
My dolls. We can pretend.
I shall wear it in my hair!
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
But she's dead!
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
Why hasn't he got a head?
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
So do I, Mr. Reed.
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
I've changed a lot lately.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
No it's mom.
Translation: a total geek.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Okay. I guess so.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
I still thought it was a purse.
No you don't, believe me.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
What? Why'd you do that?
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Frida? You okay?
I'm not really hungry after all.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Yeah right... You better go.
This really isn't a good time.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Your desk.
No.
Very well then. Is that all?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Oh my god, by wolves?
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Tell her I'm eating.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
The park dude was missing an arm.
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
Shut-up.
Why are they after you?
Not that.  Anything else.
No...  No doctor...
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Wait, this isn't fair...
Shut up!
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's what people keep telling me.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
I have to go...
No more than the usual.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Alan
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Don't call the Vice President!
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Check his kids.
Oh.  Excuse me.
I'm not sure.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Well -- take care.
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Certainly.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Really?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
Oh.
You weren't in the state legislature.
Home.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
What about the intro?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Leave him.
The tunnel.
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
What'dya get?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Garden?
Oh come on, Pitts...
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I couldn't stop myself.
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
I think you're sweet.
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Sure.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
It does?  What?
Knox?!
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Meeks.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A barbaric yawp.
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
My brother went here.
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
I... I just don't want to come.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
What?
Found what?
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
But if he said no before then...
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
No.
From you?
Neil, you're not gonna...
It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
We have to make it to the third deck...
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
I have a schedule...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
That's what I do.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
And what if I run into one of those things?
A little to the left...
Maybe plans changed...
Yeah.
Those are mine!
I'll get it! Where is it?
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
It won't open.
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
No, I --
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Oh. Fine.
Not so good.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Oh... You know...
Would you?
What kind of beer would you like?
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Pow?
Well, where's he from?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
No way. No fucking way!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
What's that noise?
Yeah.
Did you get one?
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
That's who.
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
No.
Sure.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Down.
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Kimberly!
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
When you bring in Doucet.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Yes.
Well, that's good enough for me.
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
I was set up.
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
I'll be okay.
Good night.
Hey, I'm eating.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
You treat her nice.
Hospital food.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
I'm signing off.
Take a look at this.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
Good to know you, Willy.
You know that you're in my house.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
And serve him right!
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
What's that, sir?
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
But I like the new one better.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Black Dan'l?
What Grange?
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
No, Stone!
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Some other time, Stevens.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Afraid ... of what?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
You know darn well it is.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
Shall we?
Why not -- ?
We can still use my butter money.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
There is nothing to worry about now.
Jabez --
Thanks, Mary.
Oh -- Jabez.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
But Jabez, I never said that!
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Wouldn't profit him none.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
I guess we won't.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Cup for cup!
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
But meant her moving here.
The police...?
What are you going to do?
Tell me about it.
What does he want?
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Okay.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Go fuck yourself.
Only if New Jersey counts.
Sounds better than nothing.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Ooohh....
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
Yeah... I know.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
You're really crazy.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Look... who's on the phone?
Well, then...
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
You frisk me.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
What do you want?
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
He's all doped up.
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
What now, Sonny?
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
Special to me, too.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
Yes...
Let's go, Sonny.
I want him to think that.

Wyoming.
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Have him walk in backwards.
All right. 
I want them all.
I have to see.
Okay.  Which one goes?
... Just give me time to think...
They're beautiful ...
Yeah - it looks real official.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Not now, Mom, please.
Maybe...
No!
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
Of course not ...
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>$300,000.</i>
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b>
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
She went up to her room.
Nobody.
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
So?
And?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
So, in other words, you are not down.
Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
You got a deal.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
What is?
That's my name.
Do I have to spell it out?
It's a motherfucking shame.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
We both do.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
How do you know this?
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Then we could try something else.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Yeah. How'd you know?
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
O'clock?
Gotcha.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Okay, what?
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
I don't follow.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Me too!
No.
Wow.
Go fish.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
...cause you said...
Who's your partner?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
But-
Go away, assface.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
Who?
You certainly did.
Sorry, no further questions.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Right.
Oh, you're good.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
Special Needs class.
Tomorrow night?
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You were born free and free you should remain.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Uh-oh. Harry?
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Will that be on the midterm?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Oh wow. Look at you.
And you are great in bed.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
With your permission...
Nothing.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
As the legend says.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
We call that one Muad'dib.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
They tried and died.
Those sounds could be imitated.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
Nah.  This happens all the time...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Eddie, you screwed up.
Really?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
H-how'd you know?!
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It takes me comfortable.
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
That's ridiculous.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
I told you this was gonna happen.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Hruphh...?
Would that work?
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
Okey-dokey.
Yes?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
This is my thirteenth pair.
You look beat.
"Dracula."
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Huh?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Dynamite --
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Let's get married.
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
What's uncanny?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Anything good?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
They celebrated the common person.
What if Shari's the dream?
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Good luck.

Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
When? Today?
No.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Oh my God!!
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Oh my god! On TV!
Ma...
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
She left.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I batted!
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Who's in it?
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Can't we just --
What?
I know, I ...
Shari, I really like you...
So...?
Look at this.
Somewhere.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Come on.
What do we have to do?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
We're excited.
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Oh, Jesus.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
Cassie...
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Oh, man! So...
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
That's the point -- this could change things.
But you haven't written your novel.
Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
Anything wrong?
What?
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
But, Mr. M. -
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Looks like today's your lucky day
Sporty.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
That sounds good.
Doing what?
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Hmm?
Here?
You sure?
Still clear?
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
Okay, let's say
I don't care.
Thanks!
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yes.  But do you know?
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
That simple, huh?
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Yeah, I hate them.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
<u>What do you want</u>?
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How what, Wendell?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Lynn.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
More's gonna cost you.
I don't know.  I swear it!
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
You make a mistake?
I want to do it right.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
No.
How about White?
I'll take your word for it.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
When?
Right now, before I back down.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Around.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
It'll be our secret.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Listen to me--
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Do it!
Told by whom?
Who are they?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
What do they have to do with this?
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
Yeah.
Why?
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
How?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Reynolds.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Oh my God.
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
What size?
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No, sir.
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
What?
Yeah.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
It's not real...  That's not me.
That was for Christmas.
What is it?
Oh Christ.
Why the hell would I--
It's not?
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
When do I get to meet him?
It's how he works.
Yes.
That's temporary.
How?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Seat 74.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Good point.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Where's mom?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Yeah.
No.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
They didn't take the silverware?
What?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Bobby--
They're framing me.
Jerry--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Jerry?
Go fuck yourself.
How can I reach you?
Yeah, what's going on?
The police?
I honestly don't know.
Why not?
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
Get it.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his <u>lap</u>. I want the tape and I want him. Now is--
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
What about the tape?
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
That insults them.
Excuse me?
I'd like you to have them.
No.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
No.
Don't.
Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.
It's a folk song.
Shall we be all right?
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
You will.  You will.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
Still a car.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
I was talking about the girl.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
May God make safety your companion.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Or was it Toronto?
Are you Hana?
No.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
And you've forgotten yours.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Me?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.
Apprentices.
My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
Yes.  Dropping off.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
He needn't disturb you.
Really?  That's sudden.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
Never heard of it.
No!
Yes, for your hair.
Yes.  Later.
Kip I -
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
I'll always go back to that church.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
No.  He's - no.
Hello miss.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
A bit of one.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Go away.
How awful.  What will you do?
Then you were married?
Uh. I'm showing off.
I'll call an ambulance.
I sincerely hope so.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Possibly.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
That's because I wanted them to!
It was a long time ago.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
You're not on the beat.
Duh.
The Mask.
Yes. Yes.
Okay, 80-20--
I always knew you'd do the job.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
A parting gift from the Empire.
There's always a surprise.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
You gave them the eight billion.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
Probably not.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
Right.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Cause of the chromium.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Yeah.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
If you hadn't used profanity --
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
What medical records?
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
And that's what caused the contamination?
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
Show me the document that proves that.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
What?  Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Is that what you want?
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
No one's taking anything --
And if you had to guess ...
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Right.
I think we should makes some changes.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like.  But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
Ross.
Have you been to the water board?
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Nothing.
What do you want, a joke?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
What's that?
I can't leave my job, George.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Yeah.  Who are you?
What?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
What?
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Soon, Lord Vader.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Everyone's invited, of course.
We're not out of this yet.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Yeah ...
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
He will join us or die, My Master.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
What is it?
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
Does Luke know?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Or you ran into something ....
Beautiful.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Thanks to you.
I'll bet.
You may call me Leia.
You're part of the mining guild then?
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Are the coordinates set?
I understand.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
I'll die first.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
That primitive apes can talk.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
Yes, but don't take any chances.
He's a gorilla.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
It's so good to see you again.
What's in it for me?
I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Don't like it, don't come.
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
Sewers. Come on.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
Speak of the devil!...
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
What is it my child?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
So be it.
Well hurry then, and get it.
Ye...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Without Lancelot?!
I have kept it.
You, my lord.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
I will run.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
Maybe... maybe...
Why?
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Fuck it.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
I didn't know that.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Didn't who tell me?
Please.
Really? wow.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
What!
What man?
Why the math?
A stimulant.
You're kidding! Like what?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Please go away.
Did he tell you about my party?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
The priest.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
Why, I don't understand?
But how?
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
What do you drink?
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
He's nice.
Well you know it's okay.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Oh, Christ.
Who's in it?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
You and Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
How's your leg?
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
I've seen it.
Come on!
Are you tired?
Be silent!
Maybe next time.
We have some lotion.
Suit yourself.
They're falling out.
No bones.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Huh?
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Cindy.
You got weird kids, Frank.
You look awful.
Seeing anyone in particular?
It's more than that.
I don't gotta go.
It's me.
What?
I don't know what you mean.
No.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
That's what we agreed.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I'll drop the eighths.
Okay?
Get out of here.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
You recognized me.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
A few bars!
All night?
Yeah.  You mind?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
She's a big girl.
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
What?
What?
Shut up, Frank.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
You weren't there.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Right.
I'll take the Mallory.
She asked for it.
Yes, it is.
What do you mean?
Don't take it personally.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What's he talking about?
What's wrong with it?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Right.
I said I was sorry.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Job.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
The name's Baker --
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
For a while.  She left.
Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
Nothing personal --
So why's he do it?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Sure.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Huh?
No.
Another five years, huh?
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Older than me.
Why not?
Sure.
Oh, fine.
He's losing his teeth.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Drive.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Or reactivated the first one.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
It's important.
One last time.  It's important ...
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Don't count on it.
Not if I kill you first ...
I'm going to have you fired.
I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
Castor's escaped!
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
I'm just having some fun.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Have fun at work.
Call me spontaneous.
Great.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Is that tonight?
Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
Im sure you do...
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Youre jumping, sweetheart...
Wheres my real dad?
I dont know...
I think I could figure it out.
Mom liked it.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ringing my bell...
Its not Kate, is it?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
I never won anything in bowling.
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Everyone needs something.
What?!
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
Okay, chief.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
All in one tape?
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
You hear me complaining about that?
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
What? You make me hot...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
Thats all I wanted to hear...
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Jack.
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Thats the one...
Jack.
And God love you for it.
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
Tonight.
I've got plenty of places to go.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Five times.
Ben.  Are you okay?
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Go back to the drawing board.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
That's terrible news...
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben, are you there?
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
That's good.  That's uh...good.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
Are you kidding?
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
Brain injury.
Here's the Surgeon.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
Now I know...
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
A surgeon might...
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
If there's any chance --
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Look at those Walls up ahead!
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Yeah.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Yah.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
That's right. And we need more money.
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
You're not a C student.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Oh, man!
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Sir? Right now?
Dad's here.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
What the - how's Jean?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Twice.
lot. It's a limited -
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
Mm.
Carl somethin'?
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah?
Oh, yah?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Oh, pretty good.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Anyone else residing there?
Nope.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Yah, I guess.
And his wife?
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Oh.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
It means it was homemade.
What?
Practicing what?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I want brain parasites.
Deal.
Really?
So you're staying in tonight?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
No.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Chloe's dead.
You're afraid to say.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Is that what you're calling it?
What did you say... ?
I've done you enough favors.
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
Marla...
Tyler?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this part of the test?
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
I mean -- for a living.
What?
This is how we fill up our lives.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Don't I?
Can I stay at your place?
Thank you.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Like hell.  That counted.
Strange.
The fight.
This fight, pussy.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Yes, I promise.
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Imagine how he feels.
What should I have told you?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I want to know --
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
"Training?"  Tyler...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
Why are you doing this?!
I'm doing this for us.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What?
It's free to all.
You and your friend.
How'd you know?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
He probably already knows we're coming.
Random, sure.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Who?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
What?
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
As in flannels and plaids?
Like... 4:25.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
"Next?"
Design?
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
You stopped.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Home on my strobe.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
That's an order.
I'm not jumping blind.
I know.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
You still believe in God?
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
I... You're not going to understand this.
What does that mean?
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
No.
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
I... I was just leaving.
I was nine in the sixties.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Which ones?
A list.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
<u>What</u>!?
Sshhhh!
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
Him...?
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Who?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
You're out numbered son.
There isn't any more to tell.
I never say anything I have to.
I don't drink coffee...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Now, hand...
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
Shut up! All of you!
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Is what you?
What?
Just finish eating.
No, let's go...
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Where are you going?
Alaska.
No. How much do I owe you?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Who's Van Oost?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
No, thanks...
But what about me?
I was really very moved by the way you...
I didn't have any.
None.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
What?
No, it isn't what I think.
That's right.
I'll be back later...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
At game, Carl.
I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
It is true.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Well, she was.
No.  What you do today?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
A play-ya.
I kissed those girls.
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
Which one?
What she look like?
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
I'm a good friend of hers.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
God I admire you.
Sonofabitch.
Nineteen.
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
My God, you're serious.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
No children?
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
My pleasure.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
That's it?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Of course.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Of course they are.
Why not?
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
Spot right here.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
You've met her?
Cute thing.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
I love the outfits.
I mean put clothes on.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Good point.
He never sees them and I never met them.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
But I've seen the deed.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
One.
What?
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
Irwin...
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
...never reads the paper...
Who?
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
What?  Who the hell are they?
You were going to can me, right?
John!
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
But I ain't got you...
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Actually, you may take it all now.
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
No prob...
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Contacts.
Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
What?
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
Who cares about people?
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Twelve pack?
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Two words.  Disco Express.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Okay.  'B-y-e!
Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
It is to us!  It's computerised.
Doyle.
You don't use shit?
Cause if I do.
This side.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
No... yeah...
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Il fallait le faire.
We must follow it.
Who financed it?
Yeh?  Who else?
Why not?
Where the hell is it?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
Yeah.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Third time around.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Nothing.
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
They around?
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Did he?
Do you know where I found this?
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
What?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
1998.
Nah, I gave it up.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
On the job?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
October 22, 1969.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Johnny, I know, but...
John, he's got my driver's license.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He took your wallet?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Okay, okay...
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
How'd you know my name, mister?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
What?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
I try to be.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
A hot shot, huh?
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
I don't know...
Not now.  I'm cold.
Barely.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Don't do that to me!
Your bed.
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Sort of.
Not us!  He's really creepy.
Yes.
Maybe.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
You don't "have to."
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
I wish it was.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Lake Forest Green?
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
We'll scare 'em right back.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
He didn't say anything?
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Please don't do anything crazy.
Skin stretcher was human.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
That's what I'd like to know.
For a good reason.
Gotta go.  See you guys later.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
I guess not.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
What are you talking about?
I'm staying.
This isn't a request.
You can and you will!!
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
We changed our minds.
Is the ship going to sink??
Very big.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Do not inhale.
That's where I peed.
Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
And he was there?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Don't wait Efor me.
Classic.
You're not making sense. Make sense.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Yes.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
How prominent?
Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
That's very lovely actually.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
Washed away.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Where's your elastic brace?
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
Then say it.
Because life is good.
You're out of bullets.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
What color?
Yes.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
And he has finer moments now and then.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
So do I. Over and over.
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
He goes to the theater armed.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
I'm going home to my machine.
Are you sure?
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Everyone takes his turn.
All the more reason.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
Hm.  Is it?
A great deal.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
Who are you trying to convince?
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
Again?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
In case you get back before I do.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
German, is that you?
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why would we do that?
Friend?
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
That's your problem.
I bet.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
You were asleep.
I didn't. I just waited.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
He might be ready to chop us up.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
And switched keys.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
I didn't mean police.
I think you liked it with him.
Let's do it.
No more about Beynon.
Whatever happens it's over.
You and me.
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Might try that.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Suit yourself.
Okay. How many bank exits?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Aren't we going a little hard?
Then you do it.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
You got it.
How?
Yeah.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Why?
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Doreen.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Why'd you see him so regular?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Yes.
Really?
He was here for four days.
No. I didn't know that.
Not entirely. No.
Sure I'm sure.
Was it Albert?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Have another?
Don't know.
Right.
How many?
No, you won't.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
What's that supposed to mean?
No.
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Making a living.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Nasty way to go.
That's right, Harry.
...Polacks...
It is.
That's right?
...that's right...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
Yes.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
You...
When they...
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Yes...?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Yes.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
Is that what I said?
I'm sorry?
Me?
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
In the abstract...
Do you need five grand?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I do?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Where did Moss...?  I...
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
Levene!
You're done, come down, and let's...
Would you come in here, please?
Get in the goddamn room.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
...no...
...no...
Roma.
Under him?
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Murray said...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Good.  Now we're talking.
You want something off the B list?
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Yes, I am.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Only the beginning...
Fuck you.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Harriett...
He's right, Williamson.
Kenilw...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Which...
Home...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Go ahead.
Me.
Did I...?
I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
She won't listen.
What, "this"?
Not to my knowledge, no...
You going to turn State's?
Guess who?
Your farewell to the troops?
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
I...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
They were friends.
We have no money for a rug.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
The child cannot harm you.
Let's go.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
That's what I'm here for.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
He's an Italian?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
That's off now.
How long does this go on?
Am I a prisoner?
He's not the same as when I met him.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
But if you're wrong...
What was it, so I'll know.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Good.  Then you're staying.
Did my brother go back?
You're right.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
Very well.
On a plane back to Sicily.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Very impressive.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
I do not.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
They feel cheated.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Sitting right behind you.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
Weird.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
The Master is waiting for you.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
Really?
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
What?
All right, I guess.
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
I never thought you were.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
What happened?
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
Not fear.  More like disgust.
I was an officer.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
You are much too human.
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
What was that?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Then take the pills.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
Go.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Good night.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Of course.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Tell me about Kip -
What kind of job... ?
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
How's that?
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Your girl works in there ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
You betcha --
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Not at all ...
Good.
You know where the others are?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah --
I can see that -
Me.
What?
No problem -
What for -- ?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Six or seven...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
Okay.
I always thought you'd follow me up.
Oh. Okay. Right.
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
I take out my slim-jim...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
What's that?
Hello, Otto ...
Tell me...
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Who's "Eleanor?"
So she flies -
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Excuse me --
Look at Jeannie's kid.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Anybody!  You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
Liar!
I'm in construction.
Shit.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
You what?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
What?
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
I hate to do dishes.
He's with his friends.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
That's important.
But, Paulie, please.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Yeah.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
I don't know yet.
What?
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Oh...
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Is this a bad time?
Okay.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
She's not stupid.
Yah, all right...
I told you "no" yesterday!
I don't have a VCR at my house.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
--that?--
That's enough.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Find out what?
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
I've been busy.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
That would be fine.
I do.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
About thirty million to one.
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
You're right. I know.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Have you read all these books, Will?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
--Well, maybe that means you.
You've never been out of Boston.
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
What?
Yeah.
Not to me, they're not.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
What?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
The wrench, why?
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
Sure.
No I haven't...
Then let's go have some fun.
They don't come over here that much.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, all right. We'll go.
No.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
I guess so.
How do you know that?
Then what are you afraid of?
At least you have a mother.
What about your twelve brothers?
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
You're *ticklin' me!*
Now I can't breathe.
That's not your affair. Name.
How many of you?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
No, I never. What?
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
I aim to.
Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Lissen, I heard that before--
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
You been acrost?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
No--an' look what I got for you.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
I'm ready.
Ya say we're acrost?
No.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Then what, Tom?
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
They gone.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Me an' you both.
Can you pick peaches?
We can pick anything.
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
I'm Martin Blank.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Never better.
What do you want to do?
Not much else.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
I'll think about it.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No time.
Is it something you've done?
You're a government spook?
You never could have kept this from me.
That's probably a good idea.
I'll hide.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Okay.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Okay.
Whatever.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
I'm not happy.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Never enough.
I've looked at it.
You have a headache?
No.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
Mein Dealer.
To shoot you. Correct.
How did you get this job?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?
You sleeping all right in that house?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Son?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Little.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
You already did.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
What are you talking about?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Yeah, you know everything!!
I said... I started.
So do you.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
No.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
Why?!
Night.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
She calls him Tommy...
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
What?
Yeah.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
I wouldn't let happen.
What does she do?
I don't know if I can with my leg.
What does that mean?
I want to see Pilgrim.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Cool?
It's cool!
What is it with this guy?
Shh!
That's far out!
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Yeah?
Yeah? Display?
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You're not gonna win.
And you have to smile.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Okay, thank you.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Dreams?
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
What? whatwhatwhat?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
What?
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
You don't owe me anything.
An accident?
Yes, sir.
You guys always look great.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Because the lights are all out.
Has he been prepped?
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
No way. No how.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Yeah, hurry up.
I can't.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Yeah.
Just do it.
I don't know.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Be here in a minute.
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Behind that bush there.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
That's probably all he can do.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I want to stay here and watch this.
Come with me.
Will you call me tomorrow?
It's important.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
You all right?
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Exactly what do you need?
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
Hi, Tommy.
Sure.
After the movie.
No...
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
What is it, Laurie?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
There's nothing else I can do.
Mm-mm!
Well, let's hope so.
Look at this.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
Okay.
Uh...
What?
Is this your first job?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
It does.
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
Oh, Elliot!
Yes?
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I didn't sleep all night.
I know!  I know!
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
No!
Are you in love with someone else?
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
Are you?
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
It's on the table, Dad.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 
They're in the basement.
Oh, Frederick!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh, yes, you have!
Jesus...Jesus!
You know... 
Like-- 
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
You look so beautiful.
No.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Very good.
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
He's fine.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
Football!
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Two thousand dollars.
Yeah.
She really does, though.
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh, he's such a loser!
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
Yeah.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Uh, losers!  All losers!
What's the matter?
Good.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
No!
I was so bored!
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
No, you can tell me.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Hi.
When'd you get here?
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Mm-hm.
Dad!
A reward...
And?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
Or, perhaps...
What have they got you doing?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
...very good.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...nightmare.
Their family owns...
...are they hard to get?
First things first.
Why did he come back?
Have the child taken to bed.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
You give me whatever I want...?
He is...?
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
Starling...?
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
...should love to correct your error. 
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
No, I don't get you...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
And how did he do that?
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
...not to turn around.
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
Every suicide kills two.
Why?
I don't understand.
...what did you want? 
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
It would seem.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
I don't understand.
Yes.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Wha-at?  What is it?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
That would be a No.
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
Nothing.
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I gotta...I gotta go do a "bunk check." Or some fucking thing.

That's not what I was worried about.
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Something like that. Will you do it?
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
Yeah, maybe.
Heather.
Is she dead?
Yeah, I just got back.
Give me the clipboard.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
S'okay....
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Yeah, great.
Like a suicide thing?
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Yeah. Scary stuff.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Don't move! I'll get him back!
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
I think so, man.
Punch it in!
May<u>be</u>.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
That's three things.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
I'm not hungry.
Can I go now?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
Who cares!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
Him . . .
That . . .
God, yes!
It's so beautiful!
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
You just made that up.
I understand, I think. Other women?
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
I quit. Today's my last day.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Someone special.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Ambrose. I know.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
I only married you for your body.
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
No please make yourself at home.
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Who the hell are you talking to?
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
What do you mean?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
LaPlante!
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
John, I know all about it.
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
Unprofessional.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Safety?
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Right.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand.
Sure.
Just show me the way.
Isn't that always the way?
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
About us.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
And it's a shorter commute.
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
All new houses have noises.
How long does it have to be a new house?
Oh baby.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Just reduced.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
And I can't help having a cold.
Can we keep him?
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Uh huh.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
He had to come from somewhere.
It's circumstantial.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Get outta here.
Sing.
You?
As friends -- always as friends.
If it came down to it what would you do?
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
That doesn't matter.
She's a treasure she is.
She'll soon be of age.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
I remember you.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Is it?
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
His head.  Someone cut it off.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
It's not for me to decide.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
What do you want to do?
I understand.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
You think we should take that chance?
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Not if they're looking at something else.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
I gotta piss real bad.
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
You can't run with suitcases.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
What I want is to help my father.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
I can't go without Thomas.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
What's my name?
What?
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Where's the office?
Where are you right now?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
No!  They're right here --
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
We are looking for you.
Let me see your identity card.
I don't have that much.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Where is she?
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
Satellites?
Well rewarded Those were his words.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No, sir.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
You will tell them the truth.
Thank God.
Why sir?
He will be here.
How can we help him.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
You cannot go alone.
In Ruhengeri?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
We are almost out of everything.
Why?
Many times.
Many beers.
Who is this Simon?
Can I help you?
-- bullshit --
Not at all!
I'm moved beyond words.
Oh dear.
I don't know!!
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
-- in the act.
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
-- no more --
It works.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Oh, dear.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Good-bye.
By freeing them.
I don't understand.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Who...is Colleen?
Go to your room!  Now!
I'm ok mommy.
Daddy, please!!!
Were you fooling with the power?
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
What about keeping an open mind?
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Are you ok?
What are you talking about?
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Before.
Maura.
It was a shame.
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
What's going to happen?
And what would you do?
Runic?
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
That is the story of my life.
Then tell me what to do.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Would you know this store again?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
I don't know.  Maybe.
A prize?  For what?
Yes.
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
You're apologizing?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
"You could be swinging on a star."
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
Why try?
But I said I was sorry....
Okay.
Don't worry, we'll get it...
Get em....
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
God go with you, sister.
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Never, why do you ask?
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
You want an address on that last one?
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Shucks.  Guess not.
With a little jazz.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
I'm plenty happy!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
The couch, please.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
You know, on farm route 17.
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Your i --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
As a three-dollar bill.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Says who?!
Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
Tell me about it.
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
But, buddy --
Get up!
It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
-- tough titty toenails!
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
She sits down.
...adenoids.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
She is!
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Alive?
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
Thank you.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
The West Indies?
Mr. Holland?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Of course, Wes.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
I'm sorry...
Wesley can be very entertaining.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
Help me? How?
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
You want that?
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
What about her?
Right o'.
No thank you. We should be off.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
I do. I'm -- are you...?
That shirt?
See for yourself.
No advice from the experts, huh?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
That this was going to be a key party?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
It's what?
It was lovely!
Let me.
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Well, we can talk about it.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Hi Wendy.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
See ya.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
What?
Am I right or am I right?
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Let's see!
No!
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Truly? Do speak.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
No one.
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Out.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
With who?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Yeah? See ya.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
One more shot?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
But there wasn't any...
Yeah.  All over.
Who's playing?
Where is he?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
I told her to come.
First I need a copy of the key.
I beeped you over two hours ago.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
How do you mean?
You know my plan of action.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
I'm not expecting anyone.
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Ran like hell to go to him...
That's a long time.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
That's what I said.
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
What was?
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
She used some stupid code name.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Yes down at the station.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Are you the leader of tis group?
You mean we are not children of Satan?
No.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
We want no quarrel with him.
How he must have loved you.
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
What plans?
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
What have you done?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
Still my beautiful child.
Yes...
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Come, Claudia...
Be still!
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Yes...
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
I didn't want to kill her.
Lestat, what do you mean?
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
I also promised Tyrell.
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ben Willis.
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
I'm sorry.
I'm okay.
Deep breaths --
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
It's...him.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
I guess so.
I trusted you.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
All the graves?
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
I was looking for you.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
Whet do you mean?
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell 
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Yes?
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Carter  bank examiner.
Yeah, very funny.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Made what?
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
What's that book you've got there?
I know that girl!
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Mother . . .
Mother? What do you want?
Give the flower a drink.
Yep.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
All in . . .
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmm . . .
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No, sir.
No.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Oh . . .
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Well, no younger than I was.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Harry . . . Harry . . .
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
They're not my children.
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Well, then, sit down.
Darling, you're wonderful.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
I've eaten.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Well, I don't know....
How fast is enough?
So's mine.
No.
They're moving pretty fast.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
It's not going to be easy.
That's awful.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
It's still there!
Happy to do it.
What camera?
What?
The Shark's mouth.
Sound?
In the den.
It's an island.  Got to run.
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
I know you did....
Mike's out there.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Did he raise the Kids?
Shouldn't he be at home?
Sure they did....
Great.
Okay, okay, coming....
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?
Give me back my hat!
What about sailing?
Great.  I got some wine.
No.
Name it.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Might as well.
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
He's going with you, Doctor.
And a missing man.
What is it, 97 days?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
After what happened to us?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Recovering nicely.
I have to get out of here.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
You wanted to know about a cave?
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Nobody told me.
Fine.  Have them do some.
I told you, something's upset them.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Not at all.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Brian, he's coming around!
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
You like Florida?
Sure am.
How come?
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
The one that goes underwater?
Come on, it's fun!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Now what's this do?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Aww, can't I keep it?
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Buzz off.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Oh...
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Something wrong?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Sure.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
That's what grandmas are for.
But you always let me....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
He told me you both did....
It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
We forgot to stop at the store.
We need beer....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
I'm not doing anything.
Adds flavor....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
You check it....
Good night, Daddy....
You guys must be starving....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
I'm fine....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
I have to get this finished.
Promise me....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
It could have been an accident....
It was no accident....
I can't....
Where do I pull off...?
A big one....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Good.  I have two left....
What?
I borrow it without telling him....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
I have coffee in the thermos.
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Aye, aye, Captain....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
Try the area around the wreck....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
We'll pass around cigars....
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
They won't fight with me....
I didn't do it on purpose....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Down here....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
We got it together, Jake....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
So did I....
How long?
How long has he been here...?
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
It'll work....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
What does that mean?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
How'd you do it, old man?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
So am I. But where's my money?
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
I'm going up to the institute.
Hey ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
No.
Have you got a print from the hand?
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
Bullshit.
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
I was married to her sister ..
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
What was she like?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Ugh!
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Listen to me, it's over.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
And have fun at your bachelor party.
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
We are?
I just got goosebumps.
Do you have something to drink?
We will be fine!
And I am...
Plus, you could use that commission.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Same to you.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Easy, easy --
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
What --
I don't need you to "stick."
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Oh my God.
You.
Fine.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
I think so.
Fine.
How sad --
I'm fine.  What's up?
You wanted smaller.
They do, my brother.
Let's go the zoo.
Can you be quiet?
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
Quiet!
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
You couldn't have made that jump.
How low?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
then we should...
I didn't know, there were two islands.
I thought you were an expert.
Sure.
Not if it can't dig.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't think so.
You think they could talk to each other?
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Any weapons, radios?
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
This plane can not land!
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
That was about a year ago.
That Richard.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
On the side of that one truck.
I'm fine... I'm fine...
How close do you have to be?
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Isn't it obvious?
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
It has a broken leg!
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Oh, no!
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
No.
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Damn!
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
Shhhhh!
These are dilated.  Take a look.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They smell.
It's my favorite.
Not just every six weeks.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
Like hell it is!
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Yeah.
Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Yeah, they hate me.
No.
I didn't say you were scared.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Ray, start the tour program.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Help me with this.
I really think we should go back...
Other guy?
Who's there?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
What is it really?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Yes.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Then its authority is in doubt.
Did you see him?
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
-- Eduard --
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
I've never seen you here before.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
... All right.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
I wouldn't put it past him.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
I don't know.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
... Just a perception.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
What's to become of us now?
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Value? ... Value?
Leave it, Ann.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Jack!...  Jack!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
That's too bad.
That's your monkey, Denham.
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Yeah.
Uh uh.
Sure dear, yes.
Mm.
Guess!
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Well we're pretty --
Like for you to look for the man.
-- We can talk --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Why?
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
I can't say he was anybody!
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
No, I said what did you think.
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Don't worry.
We did this before.
My bed.
Drop it.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Trask wants to talk with you.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Well as a matter of --
You must be discouraged.
You were hired to look for Tom.
I've just got a few --
Has she talked with you since prison?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
I looked it up.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
He's in his room, playing.
You got a letter from mom.
I'm allergic to onions.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Sleep tight.
I love you...
It's my name too.
Uh huh...
Are you going to get remarried?
Was there Burger King?
What else wasn't there?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Sustained.
Did you wish to?
And what is your present salary?
Yes.  Very much.
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Yes.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
What?
Yes...How's Billy?
A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Only can I still see him?
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
I don't know, Jim...
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Kramer--
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
How many?
Ten.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
How many onions does it say to use?
I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him.  I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you.  You're a good mother.
Ted, I just heard...
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Ted, what are you talking about?!
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Are you, General?
I have a copy for you.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
Did you receive the letter?
I am afraid.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Yes.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
We do not know.
You could buy them.
I am him.
Is that big?
The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Can India help us?
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
You will always!
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I have smarter men.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
Too young?
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
Mr. Cyr!
And what would he do come winter?
No!!  Out!
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
I coulda shot you, you--
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
You talk to Bickerman?
That hurt my feelings.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
Good.
Good.  See ya soon.
That's probably good.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Night.
What?
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Well...
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
I'll call the coroner.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
I'll take it!
Did he say anything?
I'm fine, thank you.
Not yet.
What kind of backup do we have?
<u>We</u>?
Was he swallowed?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I want you to go there.
Wild guess.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
<u>You</u>?
Liar?
Shitbutt?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
I understand.
Oh.
Yes sir.
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
Point taken.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I have no doubt of it.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
No. You ate yours.
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Why? Do you know something about him?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Ahhh... Why?
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
The death of my father.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
How long did you live there?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Yes, Doctor. Please.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
So you ran away...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Maybe...
Our father? Did you see my father?
...never doubt what you are doing.
Alice?
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
I sent three men to Webb!
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
That is sedition! Treason!
That is the truth!
And if we're unlucky?
Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
And what is that?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Wampum?
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
And this?
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
I'm not a doctor.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Stay calm!
What has?
That's an order!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Maybe they already have.
Can't we fix it?
All right...
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Timex...
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Itches like hell.
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Let's hope it holds.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Well what?
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
You get the guns?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I am not fucking interested.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Can I help?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Good job, Chris.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Just carrying a bag.
Sure is.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
No.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
I'll only be a minute.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
I want your bar.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
My van is half full.
So?
That's going on optimism.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
I-I can do the job, sir.
I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Please.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Colt Peacemaker.
You still going to all the home games?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
No. You?
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
Come on in--
But they were Indians themselves.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
Made some money, came back here--
Cliff--
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
We been through this before--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Have we had trouble there before?
Appreciate it, sir.
You get much of that in here?
And people make their choice--
Why would you want to do that?
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Quien es? [Who is it?]
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
Do you?
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
You gonna stay out here?
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
We haven't talked since high school.
Are you okay?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Most people did, yeah.
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Yeah.
The Republicans?
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
You sell much out here?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Another woman?
Otis what?
I know that.
You going to tell him?
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
Who?
How?
Why?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
--vanished.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
I like to know why things happen.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
A Mister Quaid?
She has no real grip on reality.
Does anybody?
Harry D'Amour.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
For what?
Have you been in?
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
I can't... I can't go any further...
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
Yes.
No!
Yeah, I'll stay.
I'm thinking about it.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
No way.
Charlotte, who?
OK, see you downstairs.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
No, yes, it does...
We established that we have no communication.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
You are.
Four.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Oh?
Yes?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Ok, well... I love you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
It's Lydia, your wife.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
What?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Good...I'm tired.
That's ok.
Bye.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
It's amazing  there!
It's probably trivial.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
When did they find her?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Must be a spare set.
I found the pentacle.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
It's nothing.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
He spoke to you?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
And also that...
What's that got to do with you?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
So what?
Yes.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Comfort.
What are these?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
What did he say to you in French?
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
Parents died?
What happened?
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
Need any help?
I can manage.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
He's fine.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
Sort of.
That was two words.
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Then I'll get you some punch.
Shh.  It's okay.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
It's okay.
You might be the only one with a job.
I don't know sometimes.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
What?
I know.  But chances are...
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
What's up, Sidra.
Just like that?
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Big-ass titties?
Didn't know you cared so much.
I don't.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
You had four offensive rebounds.
You sure?
Whatever, big head.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Clothes.
Plan to.
Right here.
She understands.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
You weren't at my game.
Woman...
Cheap date.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
You don't think so?
So that's it, just forget about us?
Yup.
No.
Thanks.
Then why are you so upset?
So?
Your hair looks so cute like that.
Well, can you give him this for me?
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
What are you doing in my room?
Later when?
That's right.
Okay...
Why?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I ain't a damn liar.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
What's wrong?
Hello, Phil.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
I'm coming!
It's fine.
ok.
Yeah.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
You wanna go on a date with me?
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Eight o'clock?
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
I'm sorry --
Yes.
I want a shot of tequila too.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
-- no.
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
DAD.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
What's up?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Picky, picky.
Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
It's...doesn't matter....
Do me a personal favor --
You got it.
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
No.
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
I think you have the wrong number.
No.
Alright.  Thank you.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
I would just want to clear some things up:
Yes.
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Mm. Hm.
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
Yeah.
I'm quietly judging you.
You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.
-- fuck you.
She's retired.
He passed away.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Ok.
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Mmm.
I live alone.
No I Said.
I went out last night.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
What happend to you?
Fuck no.
Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
It'll take the pain away.
It's not really pain.
Do you love me, Rose?
Paula.  Ellen.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Did you ever touch her?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
mmmhmm.
Ok.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Shut up -- shut up --
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
I'm fine. nothing.
Why did you do this?
..sorry...
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
M'lady...?
No, stay back!  Stay back!
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
He is your brother!
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Three days??!!
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
But why?
Did she have tits like that?
Oh my friend.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
To kill the king.
The King killed my son!
Porthos told me.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Your Majesty has had many women --
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
What number, on the first page?
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
Oh Louis, Louis...
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
Yeah...
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Not with this...
County jail - get in.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
I don't recommend it.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Christ!
Twenty minutes max.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
What's one way?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Tell me now.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
What?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
It's me.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
No.
Yes.
Oh, God.
Uh... sure...
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
No. I can help you.
Most people are.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
What about the dog?
He asked how you are.
And you said?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
I have to see somebody.
Then why?
Will...
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
What's the problem, Molly?
That's right.
Yeah...
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
She got all right?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Yes.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
May I keep the file?
Pretty well.
Yes.
I hope you have a second chance...
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
George, I hate sitcoms.
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
But wasn't it funny?
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Andy!
B-but I have them.
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
Have you told your family?
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Yes, your Holiness?
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Don't believe everything you hear.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Bob Gorsky.
It's my name.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
He'll be contacting us again.
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
Know what?
And you are?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
The Matrix isn't real!
They'll be able to track it.
Yes.
... Yes.
It's an honor.
Do you want to know what it is?
What does that mean?
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
Yeah.
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
She helped you?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Yes I do.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Yes, sir.
He is the One.  He is the One!
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
Who are you?
... shit.
It's going into replication.
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
Is it?
Should I be?
She told me...
... right as rain.
What?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Zion?
It's a city?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What do they want?
What are you talking about?
Why?
Guns.  Lots of guns.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Let go of her.
You got sparklers?
Can't we come with you?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
Salute!!!
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Thanks for the ride.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Wouldn't bother me.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
How?
I understand.
Don't be smart.
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
No you're not...
Come on.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
What pipes?
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
No you weren't.
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Here.
It's all right.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
Charlie...?
Anything specific?
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
 Shut up.
Come on.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Who's Annie?
But what?
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
And a glass.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
What'd it say?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Are you running this Board or am I?
Thanks, Quince.
Are you?
That's what he said.
But I didn't mean to do it!
He said that?
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
Confused, huh?  About what?
You love Allison, don't you?
That is not my intention.
I haven't.
Do you love Drew?
Not now.
I am, too.
No.
I don't know who you are.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
We know all that we need to know --
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
I won't.
No --
You've got a deal.
I guess so.
Yes, Bill.
Make an exception?
So can I.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
I wouldn't put it that way.
I'm her father!
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
And I don't give a shit.
Say again?
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
An offense --
That's me.
You fill the bill, Bill.
Then don't.
It's enough now.
Please.  Talk to me --
I'm here.
What question?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.
Joe?
Nothing lasts.
Did I say something wrong?
No, it was so right it scares me.
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
That's it?
What?
A cop?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Do you remember me?
Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
I don't want your fucking money!
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
What?
I'll go see him.
And? 
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Who?
What's this all about?
That's different.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Shut the fuck up!
Thank you.
Who's your boyfriend?
Teddy!
You're in a playful mood.
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
Probably left it in your room.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
Shut it, Teddy.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
She couldn't.
I won't be happy until you leave town.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Why not?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
Sammy didn't have a wife.
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Yes, I will.
Somehow, I'll know!
I thought so too! I was sure you'd				* remember. But you didn't.					    *
Lemon or lime?
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
We're not certain!
Tell them what you want.
Sure.
Yes you do...
I got to talk to my ADO...
How many?
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
Cost less.  That's the point.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
No.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
I would never doubt you.
Then you should.
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
"Salutations from the south..."
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
I know. Scribbage!
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Don't say nothing about you either.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Gonna be like money from home.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Listen!
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
How far?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Would you recognize him again?
Stupid.
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Be tough on 'em.
That doesn't seem so bad.
What do you mean?
What?
I want to cut his throat.
You know where it is?
My passport!
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Lady...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Take a look.
Right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
20 minutes.  Susan?
You got a better way up?
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Please.
You did!
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
No, there's...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
What-
Peter-
Jump in.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
What's it about?
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I'm...
I don't know.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Great.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
It'll only take a second.
Yeah, yeah...
Why would you lose me?
You've been out of your room.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Just from his agent.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Great.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Not possible..
Magic...
Ahh..
And my room?
Lovely.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
In any case we don't want your cash.
..in the building...
Right.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
You don't trust me.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
I've no doubt.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Affirmative.
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
It's going to be okay.
Like?
Twice.
Not necessarily.
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Very.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
That simple, huh?
Why not?
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
I told her to get outta there.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
By asking me.
So what do you suggest?
All ten million.
Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
Krieger.
We got it.  On your feet.
Sleeping's better.
Don't move.
What happened to Jim?
What happened to Jim?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
I'm going to answer it.
You didn't have to.........
We did what we had to do.
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
Yes.  I see your point.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Why don't you come back with me?
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Like Job?
Very good.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Time up.
My contact is extremely shy.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
I thought I'd take some now.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Good luck.
Of course I can hear you.
Jack you're so wicked.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Twenty minutes.
I want you to stop seeing her.
You haven't said anything.
What's your news?
Again?
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
Yes. Do you want...
Instantaneous.
How many men since then?
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I'm a wolf?
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
I was dead.
Loretta.
Get all of me. Take everything.
That light.
Take it easy.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
What did I do?
You ruined my life.
Oh no I didn't!
Alright.
Thank you.
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
I wanna go home.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
Right.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
A month from today?
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
I must ask for that back.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
Sure!
Will you join me for dinner?
Nerves.
Yes.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
He's a plumber.
Well. That explains it.
Marriage is happy news.
Look.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
You see that moon last night?
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Burn them.
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
No one live there.
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Oh!
Oh!
Yes ...
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What?
Come Here.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
Well, what are you then?
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
Just keep me covered.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Greetings King Arthur.
You got us all worked up.
Charge!
I'm thirty-seven.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Yes, Lord.
... Well, we did do the nose.
I'm not dead!
I'm getting better!
Do me a favour.
What is your favorite colour?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
To seek the Grail!
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Rather what?
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
If we ... er ... 
You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
Camelot ...
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
I didn't.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Not down south you don't.
I'm getting dressed.
She'll be worried about me.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
It's what the maids are for.
Are you all right, Barney?
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
It's so infernally cold in here.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
And that is my last word on the matter.
How will I know?
Her Highness' Equerry.
Yes.  I do.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
No.
It can wait.  Anything else?
Don't think I can't persuade her.
Dare say you can be taught.
I'm glad of it.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
I'm breaking no promises!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
Dear oh dear.
The same, your Majesty.
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
I understand he was in a fight.
Has he been hurt?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
He is sick, ma'am.
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Yeah...
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
What the hell are you talking about?
It is.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
I can't believe you made it!
Put in a quarter.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
I know.  It sucks.
One.  In case...
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Check your read-out.
And then keep on driving?
Thought so.
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
Yes...but...how did you...
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
So how do I start?
Who fired everyone?
What do you mean "you know"?
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
You gotta be kidding?
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
What did I say?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
Right. See ya.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
Yes, there was.
Was anyone hurt?
May I have your name please?
Number 17.
No.... I don't...
Okay.
No.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Oh boy.
You see what I mean...
Could be unrelated.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Not a coke or anything?
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
Sure.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm leaving.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Great...
Bye....
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
What ?
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
So ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
I am thirty two.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
John, sir.
Sir ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I was.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
Aren't you the bitter one.
Bruce has just awaken.
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
How can this happen ?
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
Ohhhhh.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
I would do it again in a minute.
Me, I'll know!
What do you remember about her.
I'm leaving Sunday.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
I figured you did.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
What boy likes you?
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
No.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Does she?
I'll try.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Give it back Nicholas!
I want juice!
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
What, you think the guy should change his name?
You would.
Does it work?
Give it to me!
Leave me alone!!
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Wow!
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
It would be fantastic.
Hey! Oh look.
O.K.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
The boss is watching us...
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
I think it's still available.
They're dead?
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Did she ever see Vada?
Goodnight.
You can get the general idea...
Did you ahh, love him?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
Ahh, maybe next summer.
She likes to play bingo.
No, sweetie, not yet.
What are you doing.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Yes.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Thank you. Bye.
That's really cool.
Oh.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Thomas?
Mostly love, and romance.
No.
The boys at school don't think I am.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
I will I promise.
To chocolate?
Hi Mr. Bixler!
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Hurry!
Uh huh.
Okay, OW!
What's wrong with your eyes?
What?
You have no personality.
Heaven.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Close your eyes.
Okay on the count of three.
Umm, Ummmmm
Okay.
For what?
... weeks.
Kindred spirits.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
No, he's ruining yours.
And you believe that.
Ben Gay.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
I can't even say it.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
You need a few dollars.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
Only.  If he wants to.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
It doesn't say th...
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
I need you.
Waiter! Check, please!
I never eat when I'm serene.
No.  I've got you.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Well, it happens.
Shhh.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
That is so romantic.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
If you find her...
Like family, huh?
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Grand Old Opera --
No.
Don't feel that way, honey.
How did you come in here?
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
They can come to the concert in the park.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Who the hell is he?
He has that sign with the tree.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Where the hell have you been?
Not yet.
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
She had on high heels?
I feel really good.
I don't think so.
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
When I was little, in church.
Yes, it is --
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Who is this?
That's not quite what I had in mind.
I've got a gig tonight.
I'll be there.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Oh --
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
I know a couple.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
What...
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
You've heard of it?
I see.
She doesn't talk?
Describe Mallory.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
That's indescribable.
When have they ever been right?
Yeah, we have a van.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Yes.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
You made every day like kindergarten.
And a snake-eye glare.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
Wayne---
Rockin'!
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Okay.
How so?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Well, what d'you know?!
Don't start no trouble, boy!
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Walker and Williams.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Have anything in mind?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
How about another beer?
No thanks.
What is it?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Don't Duff--
I wouldn't have let you.
Why did you?
No.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Four.
I'll have some coffee, please.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Go on - hit me!
Well, I haven't come around.
How come you keep askin'?
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Yeah.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
What're you going to do?
Okay.
'Don't sound so sure.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
No, thanks.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Going back, huh?
Who is?!
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Like hell you ain't!
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
What about her?
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Why not?
You son of a bitch...
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
You're pleasant tonight.
Yeah.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
Can you walk?
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Jah guides us.
Maybe so...
Right...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
No problem, amigo.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
What are you talkin' about?
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
Case.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
So you're a wire junkie.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
I'll be okay.
I know you have. C'mere.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Like what?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
No Roger from op/ed?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
You need my help?
Hidden camera.
You crossed over.
Five-- Six--
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A flack jacket.
A--flack jacket.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Oh. Right.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
Dude, you rock!
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Really?
wasn't even thinking about-
Sorry. Forgetful.
Thank you.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
I don't have to say that.
When are you going to open your eyes?
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Why?
Who are you guys?
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
Taste it.
Just out for a while.
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Ken!
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
He'll die with me!
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
Ah, nothing.
Let me look at your eye...
Yeah?
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
About what?
I'll get over it.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
I killed him!  I killed him!
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
I can't!
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
Making friends?
Sure...go ahead.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Did she always have nightmares?
I thought I'd wait for you.
Mom?
Don't hold your breath.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
Deal.  Thanks.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
You did it the other night.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Didn't get much sleep.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
I'm serious.
Just until we get things under control.
Then maybe you're ready.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Mary Helena.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
Oh, stop showing off.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Ahm...
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
You think I should do Henry James instead?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Is that right?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Working with Leonardo.
Well, yes.  Groovy.
It was good.
What's your name?
Well, fire away.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
I suppose so.
Definitely no comment.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
So not over her, in fact.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
What?
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
Why not?
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Yes.
What?
What book?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Y-y-y-yes...
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
Sorry, ma'am.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
So do I!
No, it was irresponsible!
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Ca-na-da...
Sure, Mack...
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
They went that way.
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
What?
With your own two hands?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Just warmin' up.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
No!
No!
Oh, do you do much fishing?
In what way?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
You look pretty healthy to me.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
Oh, yeah...
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Are you a doctor?
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
Buona notte.
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
Your great aunt.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Dwayne?
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
No.
Hi there...
Who's this?
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
That was before I found out what it was.
NO.
So it wasn't real.
What?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
What?
Yes.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Beautiful place...
Really...
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
How about the other one?  His friend.
So, what's your point?
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
Why don't you ask him?
Yes you did.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
You're coming with me?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Polo.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Nope.
Why?
Is Damon Bradley here?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
When you could've found one in America.
Uh huh.
Kate.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
Ten billion to one.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
Then don't.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
See! You don't understand!
You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
Why Edie, I
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
I better see you get there.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
What?
I only live up there and across the roof.
It's quite  nice.
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Don't say that, Edie, don't...
Told him what?
You... .
Edie it's
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Farm...
You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
Who is he, Pop?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Let me by.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I'll find you a priest.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Give me that gun.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
So help me God!
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.
Take it easy.
Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top oor the folks are usually out.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Looking for me?
You was a Golden Warrior.
Hey look-
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Something's making that music.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I am--It's our only chance.
You love me then?
What kind of symbol?
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Well then let us proceed.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Oh, if there is only time!
For what!?!
We don't know of anything, Master...
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
I said not as a rule.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Just that she got away.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He knows where she lives?
Two hours.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
You know how I felt about her.
You find out?
They sure do.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
Is that what you would've done?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
Call and tell you.
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
How are you, Raymond?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Another C.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
I thought so, too.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Yeah...
Really.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
He killed a police officer.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
You know what I mean.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
I hear six.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
You goin' right back to work?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
You're not?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Why's that?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Me?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Just a minute.
No.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Something better.  Open it.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
He's still married though, huh?
He's about to.
What'd I say?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
When's he due back?
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
Are they dead?
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
So what are you saying?
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
I can't make it.
Yes you can.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Bombers.
What do you get for winning?
You too, Lieutenant.
I was hoping to meet him.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
Have the planes made it to China?
All of 'em.
Crank her!
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
Peggy Sue!
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Wouldn't we all.
I can't. It's all too much.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Come on, let's dance.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Why?
What am I going to do with you?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
I just can't trust you anymore.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Charlie? Was I dead?
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
Are you for real?
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
It must run in the family.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
I'd love to.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
What a treat.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
You look exactly the same.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I... um...
Pretty much so.
I suppose so.
What do they do up there?
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
I'm not hungry.
Just until he heals up?
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
What did?
What do you mean?
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Bailey, Brackman.
Allright. Calm down.
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
I said, don't worry about it.
Drew!
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
I'm not ready to die.
No sweat, buddy.
Of course.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Funny.
Continue.
Nine.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
As in, the vegetable?
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Arline?
It's me, you dork.
Get it?
I suppose you could say that.
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Is that a question?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Probably since she was born.
Yeah... ?
Now that you mention it...
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
On behalf of the defendants?
Andy, you don't want this.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
He was doing a great job.
Lookit. Lookit!
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
As fast as you can.
We can't make it.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Here. Make it easy on you.
But they...they could still be....
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
You barely know them.
Like the light is scalding it.
Can we switch?
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
Smoke screen for what?
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
And pointless.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Not staying in here another....
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
About the girl.
Not if I'm the one.
What if you're one of five?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Do you have any weapons?
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
Well, maybe they're not.
None at all.
Let's find them all.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
I'll see.
What signal?
Climb off me, will you!
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Fine. Just let her out.
What?
Why special?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
With one of them.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
Then you admit --
Twelve hundred years ago.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
We can't.
God bless you.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
How the hell did he get away?
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
You lame or something?
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
...See them go down? Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie!! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!... Crawford! 
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
And you, do you believe?
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
I don't know.
Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
What did you say his name was?
And do you amuse the guests?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Much too late.
That's all there is.
Bad enough.
Then he's got to be a detective.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
They'll look for you.
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
Wonder what?
If I did-I don't-now.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Right, Miss.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
You've had dealings with the police before?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
What will they do to you?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
We know everything.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
What are your rates?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
Get it in half an hour.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Round of golf Saturday?
Thanks.  I don't mind.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
That COULD BE TOLD.
No idea.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
Recently, then.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
We don't need him.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
I've met her.
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I am a fool.
I'm interested in who handled it.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
Right.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
I think you'll do very well.
Yes.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
I'm not sure I can face it.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Freshman and sophomores...
And to history.
And I didn't like that man.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
I haven't really thought about it.
We were just chortling over that. Blas and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
Come on.  Hand over.
You approve!
Mmm...
Are you up to something?
Thanks.
All right.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
That's good.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Voila!
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
A little mushy.
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Thanks, buddy.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Figured you did.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
Warm them up.
Tyler, put the gun down.
My name's Johnny Utah!
You never did know when to quit.
This gets better by the minute.
The best friend I ever had.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Twenty-five percent.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
The price just went up to ten.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Not exactly.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For an hour.
Do you plan everything?
Right.  So!  In town on business?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
I sell them.
What?  Why?
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Not... quite.
But you want days too.
Did you buy some clothes?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Television?
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
He died a long time ago.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
What if someone tries to steal it?
I'll guard them and you with my life.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
But don't they have it in English?
I more than liked it.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Was that you?
What kind of school?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Rent.  You're late.
Vivian.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
I was in here yesterday.
Yeah.  Thanks.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Of course you will.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
What? -- go on --
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
What is it?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
Yes.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
You want me to read this or not?
As you wish...
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
It won't be easy, Sire.
And our assets?
Light him.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
And what is that?
I ought to be after twenty years.
Get used to disappointment.
That would be inconceivable.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
Good, what is it?
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Where?  What?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
What did I do?
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
You're going to jump on me.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
How's this? 
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Oh.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
To failure!
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Double.  Double.  Double.
What is it?
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
No kidding?
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Wagner...
Nietzche...
Nietzche...
Hindenburg...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
How early?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Who are you, friend?
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Is Mary here?
I want to know if my sister is here.
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What do you know about it?
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
An hour! Or less!
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Hospital clean.
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Bates.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
You'd know, of course.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Now what?
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Haven't any.
Satisfied with your cabin?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Just before she died she came to--
Who are you? What is your name?
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
But where do the rats come in?
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
The master ... is asleep!
The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Lone.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
Well, I do say it.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
What do you think I am?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
What do you mean police dog?
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Who'd steal her body?
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
You did.
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
Okay.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
What?
Is Rose here?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
I know, Mother.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Well, all right.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Am I hurting you?
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
The girl strikes like a cobra.
What's taking the rascal so long?
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
She's getting herself up to go out.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
Yeah.
I can't see, let me see...
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
What are they doing, Doll?
Buddy, that was my place.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
I'm not hungry.
Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Your baby?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Oh, yeah?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
She has other things to do, Dave.
Yeah, I remember it.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
She looks terrible, just awful.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
You're so sweet.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
It'll get better now.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Who cares?
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Fair enough.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Save it.  Just go.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
There'll be other chances.
Where have you been?
You can't be serious.
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Can't be worse than you.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
I know it is, even if you don't.
All for one...
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
Beholden to none.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Do tell.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Are you all right?
Oh... great!
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, sure.
Leia!
Ahhh...
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
I will not fight you, father.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yes.
Oh well.  How about you.  
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Janet.
I've got something to say.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You know this earth - this person.
Makes you cry
Now I
Dealing
No no no, no no.
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Oh.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
I think it's closed.
Absolutely.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Could ya take off that hat.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
I gotta go out for a while.
What're we going to do?
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
One more round.
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Kiss my ass.
Few minutes?
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
That's it? -- Completely?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
No action.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
...Screw you, yoyo.
Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Come July, twenty-five.
...Who'd ya fight?
What's happened is freak luck.
I got pain an' experience too.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Creed's great.
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Don't get mental, man.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
...Sure.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Ice skate.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Maybe --
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
It's all yours.
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Maroon, right?
Oh, no...
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Surprised?
What am I, Earl?
Why didn't you tell me?
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
Doom.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
So what do you want me to do?
I don't work in Toontown.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maybe.  Why?
Don't ever forget that.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
I think you oughta read it to her.
From this box here...
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
I'll not endure him.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Amen
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Of course.
I don't know.
And then...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
I'd stake my reputation.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Shut up!
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
Bullshit!
What's that?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
I do, I do...
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Not for long.
My way is better.
Everybody.
Something like that...
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to do this.
I know of him.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Very ugly.
Something like that.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Sure thing, and --
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Seven thousand...
That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
All right we will.
What's that?
What are you gonna do?
He saw everything!
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
It's NOT too late!
Rock solid.
I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
No.  It's not.
HELLLLLP!!!!
Denning was wearing a bug.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
No.  But he would, probably.
I might have to look into that...
Heard you had quite a night.
I know.
Are you sure you're OK?
OK.  I love you.
I'm in here.
That son of a bitch.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
I swear to you, it's true...
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
We appreciate that.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Dwayne -
Then what the hell are you all about?
That's great Earl!
Give me the bad news.
Money.
So someone did get away.
I'm not getting an answer.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I'd like to see you try.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
So what's your story?
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
It's my job!
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Forget it.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
No.  It was my singing.
What did you say?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
What's a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
No mu-shu.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
End of the line.
Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
Did you tell Sterling?
I'll take him.
Yes, Master.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
This is pathetic.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Right....
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
It's called a dress.
He is the situation.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Han?
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Carter, can I have a moment?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
What did he ask?
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
We'll rub.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
You have one?
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Cindy the manicurist.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
You don't know.
You humiliated me!
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Quick.  Very quick.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
It sounds nice.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
About forever.
You couldn't.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Definitely.
What?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
What are your plans in New York?
No, I know that part --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I want my money.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
How amazing.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Who is this?
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
What's she talking about?
Why not?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
You want me to talk to him?
It is not --
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Seventy... eight.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
What is it?
You'll see.
It's a spice rack.
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
Right.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Okay.
Was Mom an adjustment?
It might be in the kitchen.
This is the one I like.
What's wrong with Annie?
Did not.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Well...
Yes?
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
I read an article about this ...
It takes time --
That's none of their affair.
There's nothing stopping you.
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I've had them since the day they were born.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
No.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
But honey ...
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
The what!
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
What can I do for you?
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
Yeah.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
How far out of town?
You really need to lighten up.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
I'm kind of busy.
You always been this stubborn?
I can't tell you.
I don't want to leave you.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Don't get carried away.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You're going to have to explain that one.
You aren't coming with me.
When? When did you ever see me use?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
Anything for a dear friend.
Why do you say that?
Pull your pants down.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
That would be me.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
They have. But they never found a lab.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
What is it, drugs?
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Hell, no!
Nope, he ain't Wade.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Who's Wade?
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
It's worth it.
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
Senator's son?
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Sarge?
You know classical music?
A machine gun.
That only leaves three.
The Germans do.
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
I've got a line on one.
Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Good news?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
That's a mystery to me.
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Captain, he's fast!
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Gee, it's easy.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Hang in there, man.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Meaning?
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Dad, I'm sorry.
I'm fine.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
You're going.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Swear to god.
Honey, it's not what you think.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Are you busy on Saturday?
Well, not monumentally.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Would you hold this for me?
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
No, I'm serious.
Then call me tomorrow.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Mmmm.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Yeah.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
It sounded like you did.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
One more time would be nice.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
The guy with the Datsun?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
How do you pay for one of those?
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
What?
Hey.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
What -
War.
I'm sorry to hear that.
True.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
Wine?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
So I'll talk to him about it.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
Something they can hold in their hands.
Ah, yes.
And killing.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
I'm inquisitive.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
It helped me realize one thing.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
Home--where he lives.
Yeah.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
That's not the way it's done.
And Joel's pre-med.
No, wait here.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
You're getting obvious.
No, wait...
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
I counted four.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Melinda McGraw?
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
Do I?
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
What?!
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Nope.
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
A note?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
Please, call me Gale.
Excuse me?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
No.
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
And?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Good twist.
They're the ones who approved it.
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
It is in my script.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
How do I know their voices are --
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
Oh yeah.
What are you doing here?
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
I'm going... I'm going.
What's that?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Yeah... I think so.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
What number are you trying to reach?
It happens. Take it easy.
I don't think so.
Really? What?
Uh-huh.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Sure...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
...yeah...
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Yes, sir.
Casey? Casey?
Call the police.
About thirty seconds.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
That's the original part.
Right here.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Working, thank you.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
It's past seven.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
And you believe it?
Come on, let's rock.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
There was a second.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
What the hell's going on?
It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Sit back.
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
What about them?
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
I know.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Okay.  But, what?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
It's got to be.
And you don't?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
I don't know... like fifty.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
Sure.  Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer?  Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
Okay... okay... get off.
We had him.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
I will.
What?
It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
How should I know?
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
In that case, give the boys room...
Dunno...Seems so.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
Scar?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Cut it out, will ya...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Not far from it...
Don't go blamin' yourself...
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Only if I'm dead!
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Does this dog here belong to you?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
Just call me Elisabeth.
We should leave the past alone.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
Thank you, Ned.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
The title?
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Nothing comes.
And your relations?
No, your marriage bed.
Cut his nose off.
Of course not!
But nothing is happening.
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Tomorrow
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
How will it?
Mercutiogood name.
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
When the Queen commands it.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"Madam!"
"Madam!"
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Is she obedient?
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I like her.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
I . . .
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
She loves me, Thomas!
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Will you shut up and play.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
He couldn't get his car started.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
I won't be able to.
But not quite.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Yeah?
About the mail --
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Cover it?
Well?
What does it look like?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
Well, yes.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
-- which is --
No.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
David?
Stop nagging.
No, I don't.
Who was it?
Then let's spend some money.
He can't stay up there.
That's what I thought he said.
You were going to say something.
Can we come in?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Do you smoke?
Yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
Two hundred pounds.
No.
Exactly what I was --
That's what I thought.
I see.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Writing seems easy.
You know about it?
What?
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
What?
I just thought you'd like to know --
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I gotta talk to you.
What're you doing later?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
Right now, I just don't care.
She's a friend of Jill's.
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Her?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Hungry?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
No thanks.
Am I what?
I never get my hair done.
Wonderful woman.
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
You promised you'd do the show.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Did Lester know about him?
What?
You did, didn't you?
You did, I know you did.
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
He still having parties?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
What for?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
I have to see you.
Well, like what?
What?
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
How?
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
Honey, what happened?
You're great.
I already said hello.
Right now?
When I get off work.
What?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Television or movies?
-- well aren't you --
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Well that's something.
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
I just want to know, that's all.
Yes, yes, I did.
Thank you.
In a way. But...
When?
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
-- yeah?
Layered?
Godammit, George...
Sit down.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Well, I don't know.
No thanks.
I know.
Oh yeah...
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
No.
I'm coming over.
Okay.
A daytime soap opera.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Of course not.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
But why Egypt?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Sort of.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
That's fine --
Jill.
No, it's not that...
No.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Okay.
Are you sure?
French Fries and Ketchup.
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Delbert Grady.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Sure.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
Pleased to meet you.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
What'll it be, sir?
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
Yes...
Jack...
Of course you are.
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Wendy give me the bat.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Uncle Al-
Jesus.
Went shopping. Why?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I told you!
No.
I saw what I saw.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
What you say?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
Probation?
With love.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
That man -- who is he?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Were you wicked?
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Hopeless I
She won't?  Why not?
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
You watch yourself!
Honey.
Experience!
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
It's true!
Don't you know it!
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
What?
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
No food?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
And whom would you call?
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
What do you mean?
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
What?
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I think they'd understand.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
They open a window.
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
Which one!
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Really...
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
She wasn't a nun?
Christy.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
But, Bishop...
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
I hit him square.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Believe?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
There is no such thing as magic.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
What has happened?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
What did you say?
The skull is gone.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Use caution.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Sit.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
You got any money?
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't tell me what to do.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
I'll be back in a little bit then.
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
I aim to kill you with it.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Why? Hi, Karl.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
But maybe just for awhile --
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Who did you kill?
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Hit was right thoughty of her.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
He ain't ever okay to me.
Did Karl go to bed?
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
Me, too.
You better go get 'em.
I want to come back and stay here.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
I never was no good with history.
Yes sir.
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Do you have family here?
I done et just a little bit ago.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
I reckon not.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
What about me?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Yes sir.
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
It's my birthday.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
I'd love to.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Ah-hah.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Every word.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
Yes, I suppose I do.
Eighteen and a half years.
You're looking good, Auggie.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
You what?
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
She looks just like you.
No you're not.
Why don't you open it and find out?
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
And how much are these?
I think I'll take them. 
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
It was just a thought.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Baby? And what baby is that?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Of course. Where else?
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Yeah, I can believe it.
Eight-thirty?
Three nights.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
The inspiration.
No way.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
Well?
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
None.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
You done your math right.
I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Well, what if?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
And the last...?
Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Oh, yes.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
Fell.
Maybe...?
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
The knife.  What knife?
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
I was checking the cables.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
Does it now?
No spare.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
I suppose you want a tip?
Bye.
Why?
Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
You're welcome.
It's private.  Go away.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Of course I am.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Down, Daphne!
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
How can we?  We're broke.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
What message?  What motorboat?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Like what?
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
What engagement present?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
I may throw up.
We're not on the pier yet -
Honey - she called me honey.
If there's anything I can do for you -
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
I'm a very sick girl.
I have a very low resistance.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Vanity Fair?
Oh yes, we do!
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
You're not sure?
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Wanna bet?
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Oh, no!
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
It's three weeks in Florida -
My car?  Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Yes, we're the new girls.
Oh.
I'll say.
Bingo?
That so?
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
I want mine to wear glasses.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
My fault.
Thank you.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
No, my flag steward.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Oh?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Shells?  Whatever for?
I am?
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
What a beautiful fish.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
So inhale!
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
PLEASE!
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
And who runs it?
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
What for?
You don't owe me no nothing.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
To make sure youre okay.
Still--
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
So, whats your point?
Brilliant.
I slept with your sister.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
I do?
What?
Spontaneously combust?
I have to.  Im the best man.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Ahoy!
Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Let me see it...
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Uh huh...
That does it...
That's where we come from first?
That's where we came from first.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
What he talk 'bout?
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
Yes mam...
Can you swim?
Yes mam...
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Hi, Daddy...
He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Sausage and hambones!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Yes mam...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
He can't get up, Mama!
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
I'll walk...
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
There are more important matters right now...
Doggy.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
I said -
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
Did you bring the pie and punch?
No way.
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Oh.
Something big, children.
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
It's... It's not good children.
Oh no, it's that kid.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Aw, ma!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
No, it was worse than that...
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
Don't believe the hype!!
You would know, dummy.
Terrance! NO!
I am.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Don't call me dumb!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
You didn't?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Excuse me?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Will you shut up already?
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Close every door behind you!
Even if we do, it might be too late.
I understand.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
What?  What are you talking about?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
I can't!
Is there anything I can help you with?
So I've been told.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Right, I understand that...
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
You have orange whips?
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
It was a clearance.
No kiddin'.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
100 years! 
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
She's my mom.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I never saw you.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
I found dad.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
You shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
What did you do to Buzz?
You made me hurt him!
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
After we eat, Dad.
You still got the touch Junior.
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Too late for what, Sheila?
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
He's my father.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
It?
We would have sooner or later.
Tell me what happened Theo.
You should.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
I am a professional man.
I'm looking for somebody.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Yeah.  I heard you.
Nobody move!
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
What team?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
-- Wait a second --
What team?
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
She should've known better.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Jerry?
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Nothing, sir.
In a minute, sir.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Ladies and Gentlemen...
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
That's quite a secret.
Underwater?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Yeah.  Drowning.
Get this thing off me.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
In Edmunds' things.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
Still clear.
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Still clear.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
Wait a second --
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
What?
How can the sphere do that?
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Bingo.
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
Don't you?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
In time for what?
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
Yes you are...
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
You sound defensive.
No, why don't --
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
What is it, Harry?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
But why would she -- ?
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
I heard!  I heard!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Is it?
Do you?
Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
Huh?
Like what?
Please, Ted.
Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
What?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir.
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
You don't believe in the Force?
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
I think I did.
They'll find its weakness.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Yeah.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
How do I know if this is love ?
Good luck at the academy.
I can't help it.
You're right. Let's never stop...
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Hut... hut !
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
Well, excuse me, sir...
Looks like rain.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Move out.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
To join with him.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Yes.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
You are what...?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
Our... 'insignificance'?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You quit.
Why?
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
That's true.  You grow up here?
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
...that.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
One moment.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
I hurt you?
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Gosh, you look nice.
I saw...
Drama Group?
We had a date.
He works on the movie.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
That Could Be.
Nothing happened.
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
What I...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Nobody.
We know that you weren't.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
Why?
I just...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
I know that...
What?
An artist of your caliber...
I'm only trying to...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
That isn't very nice.
She won't stop crying...
You said <u>three</u>...?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
What?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
He saw the accident...?
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
I...
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
How do you know you saw it?
I...
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
I don't got the money.
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
...not the Lazyboy...
So we just got lucky.
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
Good girl.
This is a joke, right?
Oh, yeh.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
You lost Ben?!
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
This is my house too!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Ice cold water.
There's worse things.
Cos she loves you.
Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
I knew where I was all the time.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Oh.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
So where are you?
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Because you don't really seem here.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
We're going to win this.
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Yes?
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Brad Kovitsky.
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Are we.
You weren't passing 'em out.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
So I'll have to order in?
For what?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
Maybe he's gay.
What?
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Who is Jesus?
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
No, you don't.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
What's an audience going to tell you?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
I'm going in there.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
OK!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Maybe. She's OK.
No.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
You should be.
Yeah. I know.
I mean...
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Can I see what you have so far?
Oh.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
Because I'll be firing at them.
You're talking about committing suicide!
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
Shut up!
What do you mean?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
Excellent.
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
If I don't get power up we are!
What is your name, young lady?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
You aren't sure!
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
Yes, sir.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
A shooting war!
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
I see.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
Check.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
They can't touch us at this height.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Yeah?
Some kind of signaling.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Like hell it does.
Then get off my back!
Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Yeah.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
It's really not about anything.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Shut up! Aw...
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Sorry.
No, he's not with a girl.
I'd get bored.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
A long, long, long...
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Good.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
I know, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
What?
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
No.
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Am I fucking him?
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Yeah?
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
This is private property, my friend.
Please!
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
No, no, whoa!
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Yeah.
It's nice here. It's different.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Mm-mm.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Well, w-what happened?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Just put it down.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
No.
About things that are important to me.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
No, I don't.
Oh, yeah?
God, you smell like whiskey.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Just go.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
What do you mean?
What?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
I don't know.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Fucking drunk, huh?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Oh that's nice for you.
You know the fuck not.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Cleo!
Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
Oh... What are you working on?
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Hold on...
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
Roll 'em.
Hi, Artie.
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
I just think pictures should say a little something.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Phillip, you're mad!
Life can be beautiful!
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
You did?
Into what? A lampshade?
I tell you this is half sold.
As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
So do I.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Why did she call me?
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
Gordon Cole?
You're a writer, you said.
Or teach it a better tune.
And you'll play Salome?
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
"Mad about the boy."
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
This is the right day.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
She is upstairs.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
You made her a star?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Paramount is calling.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
Sorry, mistress.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
Come on, let's ride.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
What do you feel about me?
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
Nurse!
Nurse! Help !
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Nice to meet you.
I can't help it if men notice me.
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
I knew it!
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Nope.  Never. 
Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
There's a lot of choices here.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Well, aren't you excited?
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Mmmmm . . .
What are you doing?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
I know, I'm the fault.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
The boss wants to see you.
I don't think you understand.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be "Where."
They ain't got captains?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
What do you want?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
But the bridge...
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Diet soda?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Storms! Floods!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
So far the hostages are unharmed.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Maybe I could try --
Be my guest.
I didn't think I wanted to.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Lois, I really don't see why --
Everything on it.
Uh...home...
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It's beautiful.
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
North.
Why?
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
He has powers as we do . . .
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
It will. Starting with your own.
Zod.  Zod.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
. . . Let me get my purse.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
I'll try. . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Get the box, nephew.
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
First, I have fun.
Destiny.
Albert!
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
No.
Oh, for God's sake!
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
I'd better get you down.
So I've noticed.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
He's from another world.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
La de da da...
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Two.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Do as I say. Let go!
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
How much do you weigh?
Pink.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Of time, Luthor.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Say hi to Zoe.
Why are you telling me this?
Yeah.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
I'm not sure.
Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Nicole.
That's because he misses you.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
I better get back.
I have to.
Because I have to.
Yes.
With our hands.
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
It's the truth.
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
I won't lie.
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
What do they do?
Crafts.
Tell me about it.
Here we go.
So what's the problem?
Yes.
Don't you want to hear?
Do you have the blood test?
Is there shrimp on it?
Well, let's see what we get.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Do you have this agreement with you?
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
You remember that much?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
You remember this?
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Nothing.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Nothing.
Yeah, right.
But Charlene...
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
I guess you're right, but -
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Is it news to you?
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
No.  I'm going home.
Now don't kid a kidder.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Wild?  Take a look at them and see who's wild...
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
He goes out with girls.
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
What would you think of me if -
But...
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Did you now?  On which bounce?
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Like you?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I didn't do anything!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
I made you write a beautiful song...
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
What?
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
I have detailed files.
Respect your elders and your betters!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
Yes.
You bet.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
What's in those files?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Tough, tough!
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
How?
I wish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
I have no idea.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Who's he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Absolutely not.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
You know your weapons, buddy.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
What's it to ya?
Kyle.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
It's okay.  Forget it.
You'll learn.
You like it?  It's my first.
That's the way it was told to me.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
A girl.  You know.
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Like shit, boss.
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
What are you babbling about, psycho?
I don't know... he fell.
He's turning blue!
How do you know that's the way?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
Oh.  FIne.
Yes... well...
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Why... ?
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Can we talk?
What are you talking about... ?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Guess you missed it.
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I didn't know what else to call you.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like... where are you from?
One brother, one sister.
Underwear?
Which grad-school?
Elizabeth?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Why?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Okay... okay.
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Stop it!
Yes.
I know.
What's all this for?
What kind of vacation?
Humor me with specifics.
May I make two suggestions... ?
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Goodnight then.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Did you worry about him?
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
You're joking.
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
You warm my heart.
Well, I... uh...
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Go ahead.
There's a carriage house around back.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Just stay there, Nell!
You could have.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
You don't believe in the paranormal.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I got more scared.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Mary came with me.
How could you do this to people?
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Yes.
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
What do you do?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
I don't think I want any.
Just had to be sure.
It's not a compliment.
Anything but Japanese.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
I'm a gracious host.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
You're home, then.
No reason.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
That would be too easy.
He's gotta know why.
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Uh-huh.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
No, but I know what he means.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
She never told Eddie, though.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
What do you think.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
What about your grandmother?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
He had urgent business in the north.
No kidding.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Yeah.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
I don't want you here, Terry.
Susan.
-- You know his name is Frank.
You know I don't live with him.
Are you finished?
You must know Ian.
Yes. Thank you.
And you should tell Doris...
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
We've certainly missed you.
That's what he keeps telling me.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
Geez, Mr Crane.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
Cash.
Cash?!
Yeah.
All right.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
What happened to you?
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
So... who... who actually--
I'm fine.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
How d'ya like them apples?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Jesus...
This hair.
Uh-huh.
Not an owner.
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
I appreciate that.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
Hurry up!
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
What's left of it.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
Apparently it's huge.
The sub-basement?
Everybody.  Get behind me.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Got my hands full here.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
All right everybody, hold up!
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Let me see the plant press.
What are they?
I wouldn't be so sure.
Like this.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Holy mother, what is that?
How about lunch?
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
I don't understand.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
What happened?
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
Where did you see it?
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
Wounded?
What are you going to do?
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
I can't!
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
He gave it back to his father.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
Sure she would.
Oh, yes.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
I've got to show you something.
This is where it started.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
What's that?
The thing that started all of this.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
I won't be here Sunday.
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
You blaming me for the traffic?
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
Well, I made it through another night.
Oh, just so.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
There's no one here.
I don't understand.
You can count on it.
Sorry. Don't have one.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Me?
Yes.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Nothing completely conclusive --
No, they don't.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Yeah, I did.
I know the name. Why?
He just let it explode.
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
Your guess?
You didn't know my father --
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
I'd been told as much.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
What kind of infection?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
I don't know why I think they went right.
This virus -- it... 
It may be extraterrestrial.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
Maybe. Maybe not.
And they want to blame us?
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
I want to know where Scully is.
You're lying.
A virus?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
What about you?
My life is over.  Go.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
I don't want to find out.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
What happened to Charles Gish?
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
I can't leave him!
Good for them.
I got it.
I bet we can fix it.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Completely unaware.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
What else do we do?!
Considering where I've been...
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
His own doctor?
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Silly looking bunch.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
I don't know.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
There's nothing in them.
He works in a military hospital.
Two weeks ago.
It's true then?
Good-bye.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
No.
Him dying like that.
What are you trying to say?
You're not locking her up?
Thank you. Excuse me.
Well?...
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
How about the doorway?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
All right, Calloway. You win.
I said you win.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
The author. Thought you might be interested.
You wouldn't do anything.
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
What's the name of this girl?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
What's he saying?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Funny?
He didn't want to get involved.
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Yes?
Help you out?
Just five dollars, please.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
I'm sorry.
It's on an island that no one get to.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Exactly.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
What??
That's a movie, you moron.
Then I won't bring you....
Fire...
You will.
Too difficult?
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
No.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Don't curse in front of it.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
It's the truth....
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Are all Jews the same?
So you're saying it's not true.
No.
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
Yes!
Daniel Balint.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
What kids?...
I've got to get back to the --
You could do it.
The mother.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
How?
Valentine...
Fund-raising??
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
What do you mean?
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Yes.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
In a lake.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
No.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
You know what I'm talking about.
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
What does that mean?
Then tell him to wax it too.
And... does the voice come back?
Enzo...
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
Well... about everything.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
You don't have that one, do you?
It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
Give it to me.
I got fired.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Absolutely positive.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You'll understand.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
C'mon follow me.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
He's still working out some identity issues.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Mmmyes.
Nice fellow?
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
You really think so, Charlie?
They don't say it to me.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
What, senorita?
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Oh, that's so interesting!
No. I'm quite sure.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
It was you.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Why?
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Yes. Do you mind?
You. Us.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
That depends what youre looking at.
Anything is possible.
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
I... If you dont mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. Theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
Sorry?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
...You-you spoke to him?
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
You dont say.
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
To get me killed...?
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What are you doing? You cant. I...
What do you suggest?
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Can you tell me how you spell...
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Have we done business before?
So, what are you looking for?
I see. How much?
I certainly did, sir...
Should I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
Your secretary, huh!
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
Does it matter?
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Yeah.
Three oclock.
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Shut up!
Good reasons?
Im afraid I dont understand.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
No...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Viens.
Tu sais o me trouver.
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
Fuck...
Why did you kill him?
So why didnt he?
Thats what he said...
Are they still operative?
Its a good guess...
Cost what?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Now?
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I promise...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No...
I don't remember.  Maybe.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Scared of a girl?
I'll be right here... I promise.
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
His face.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
God.
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
That's now what I meant...
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Because... I have to be alone!
God asked you to do something?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
No...
I need to confess.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Yes, it is.
I want to be with him always...
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
He's still a doctor.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Wladek, please.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
We use what?
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
Wladek! How are you?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Cow!
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
I've been worried sick.
Stop it, Wladek.
I am... I was a pianist.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
I don't want to learn.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
Shove off, Duff.
There's always a depression on.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
I can talk, can't I?
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
Neither are we.
I thought I'd lost him.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
That's why he won't know it.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
Lonnegan.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Yeh, sleepin'.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I feel lucky tonight.
Then why the rat?
Maybe a couple million.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
I'll make parole.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Come on, gimme a break.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Another young man.
And if it isn't?
Do you think I care
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Why not?
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He's waiting for you.
Hello, there!
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
What would your mother say to that?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I'll have to try to remember.
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
Man to man, I'm not.
No.
Could this be him?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Well....
He did!
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Goodbye.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Chris -- Chris -- !
I'm not telling anyone.
That's just why I'm going.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
What'll I do if something comes up?
No.
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
They'll want more than your word for that.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I didn't knock Julia off.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Room service, please -
Rye.
They were kidding you.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
There's one coming.
I'll get some towels. 
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
Did I give it to you?
Oh take it!  Please take it!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
That's a fact.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Got a nice evening dress?
I wish you'd tell me who.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
You worked here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I just wanted to tell you...
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
Break it out.
You just go when I say go.
Weird they didn't chase us.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Another month in this desert and I might just.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Roger that.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
They're not going to--
I got that...sir.
Mine.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
They can't shoot us in here.
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Damn.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
I don't have a weapon.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
We go this way.
But...
Somebody has to.
Yeah.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I don't know.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
Now you need me.
For real?  A treasure?
I could.
Naw, nothing.
That's in two days.
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
Then lets go back while we still can.
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
We have to do something.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
I think we found something.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Violation?
Too low.
When?
Looks like dirt.
What's going on?
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
You're in violation.
I'll report you.  It's....
Look!
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
What kind of answer is that?
I'm only trying to help you.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Hang on.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
What do you mean?
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
How do you know?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Nothing.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Hey, I'm next.
A bowling alley.
Reilly! He's loaded!
Insurance?
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Quiet!
Huh?
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Yes.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Doc--!
Yes, Baron.
I want to see-- 
And as for you, waiter--
You can trust me.
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Disappointed?
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
What's wrong now?
No. What is it? Tell me.
What?
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
This used to be my secretary's room.
You think that's too much?
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Like that?
So you think you can get me?
You're conceited--
I <u>must</u> go.
I'm crazy about you!
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
No--thirty-five! 
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Goodbye ... 
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Well--uh--yes and no.
How much is your salary?
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Hurry, Rose.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I was tired.
Not the better half.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Can I bum a cigarette?
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
You're crazy.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Well, here you are.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
It's so cold.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
I should like to see my drawing.
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
How'd you ever get away with it?
I never want to go back....
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Glad to see you again.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Don't be a c-a-t.
At seven-thirty?
Okay.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Who with?
You can live that down, can't you?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
We coulda got two third-class!
I'll watch for him, sir.
How're the tips?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Where did you hide it?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I should say not.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
What'll I say?
How?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Send that.
I thought I put you to bed.
I was never stiffer in my life.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
Is this your gun?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
I'm getting seasick--
--And he has sex appeal.
Get that out of your trunk.
What for?
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
Why?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Thank you.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
That's not what I meant.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
Well I'm not so go home.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
No...
Excuse me?
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Better.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
I'll remember you said that.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All right, Doc...
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
A which?
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
No.
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Doesn't suit you.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
You wanted to talk?
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I can feel your pain.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Not all of us, 007.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Nothing.
Thanks.  Take care -
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Next time, I do the driving.
I didn't say when I want to die -
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
Yes, M.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
No -
Yes -
- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
Approaching the first gate.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Thank you sir! Thank you!
We got the same thing.
Junior spends time with his child.
They're too big.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
What for?
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Why didn't you catch a plane?
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
Good afternoon to you.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Now who are we talking about?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
I already have, my dear.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
Where is Skip?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Trouble?!  Where?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Shhh!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
But why would Andy want me?
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Woody!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Look out!!
Woody!  The rocket!
How 'bout three out of five?
I don't know!
She's sick!
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Nothing.
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
No, no, no, wait!
I was close to being scared that time.
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
I can't quite make out -- 
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
I like plaits.
Home is where the heart is.
Get away from me...
You're not so old yourself!
I finished it off.
I've got a present for you...
H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Surely she is older?
Victoria -
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
Goodbye Arnie.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
Like I give a fuck.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
Who do you work for?
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I don't believe you.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
Where?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any way we can do it better?
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
I'll get there as soon as I can.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
I'd fucking kill you.
think I left something back at the -
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Right. You can't sleep here.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
Aye.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Director?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
He made me lick it.
Fuck you.
It was just an idea.
So?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
But you don't have the money?
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
As you wish.
Sure.
Sounds great, Swanney.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Closing.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Bob?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Because it's there.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Yes, Spock?
Goodnight, Doctor.
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
I did not.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
Fire the rockets!
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
I'll take you to the bridge.
Am I? We'll see.
No conditions.
You call that getting over it?
Of what?
That Dillinger's on to him.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Yeah...?
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I'm sorry -
The Pentagon?
What do you want with the Pentagon?
If you think -
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Why? What are you going to do?
How 'bout yourself?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
You're getting out of the business?
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
But-what if I can't...?
Do it!
As long as it gets us out of here
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Yeah, right.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Okay.  Here she comes.
It can't be.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, but for who?							*
What are you talking about?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Here they come.
But you didn't.  Why not?
No!  Never!
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Yes, sir.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
Sure, hon.
Are we going to die?
Yup.										*
Harry... snap out of it!
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
I understand.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
I don't know.  I have to think...
Helen.
What letter?
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Would you like to get some pie?
How 'bout me what?
There's nothing to tell.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What do you want to know?
Do you have a fella?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
Uh-huh.
What did he do to Arlene?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Is this a joke?
What?
Cancoon.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Two guys.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Yeah?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Really?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
What?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
What makes you think I would do that?
Keep it.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I don't believe you.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
McTeague.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Could we try it now?
I believe he believes him.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
How the fuck could he know?
- Because it's good!
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Exactly room-mates.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
No.
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
What are you going to do with us?
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I don't know -- I don't remember.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
You... you left them a message?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
I need to make a telephone call.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Yes, sir.
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
All right, old man.  Christ.
Christ!
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It will.
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
I need a ticket.
Where in Mexico would you like--
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
How much time?
Time.
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
How much?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
Please, just leave the car alone.
It is morning.
You got the money?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
I . . .
What does it look like?
I'm just going to my car.
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
That's all right.  I got it.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Where you headed?
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
Did you like it; me watching you?
The same thing you do.
What?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Whatever it takes.
Have you ever been there before?
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
There has to be!
Yeah.  Good thinking.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
You killed him!
He was going to take the money.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
But you said we could be together.
But I want to say with you,
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Husband . . .?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Grace, tell him.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
About things.  About your wife.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
What should I do?
It's not like that.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
It's the truth, Jake.
Come on, Jake--
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
Oz.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
What happened?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Not as bad as it looks.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Yeah...
Accident.
Like you don't know.
Would you kill her?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I'm not rambling.
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
How do you want it?
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You came to take my wife from me?
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
You're too quick for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
What the hell are you talking about?
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
Nothing.
How much!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Soda.  You know.
I got it.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You should be more careful.
You've been around.
Thank you.
Come here.
I have an idea.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Try me.
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.
You already have.
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You could give me my gun back.
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
How much?
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Yes.
What did I say?
I know.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
What was your idea Elijah?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I want to sleep here tonight.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
No.
No.
Get mom.
Is that right?
No.
Why?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Those cowboys messin' him up?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
What's your name?
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
No.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Yeah.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yeah.
I can't see 'em.
Yeah?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
HEY, KID.
Worms was comin' out.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
No... I meant...
How many you killed, Kid?
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
We'll bury him.
Yeah.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
A glass of water would be nice.
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
This whole thing was a shakedown.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
I work for Keyser Sate.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
What?
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
This is totally irrelevant.
NO.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
As far as we know, nothing.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
What does it mean?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Yes!
How is that?
I am seventy-four years old.
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
Objection.
It's a crime.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I...yes.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
'Code Blue'...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
...What difference would...
You're going to settle out of court?
I was held up.
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I'm sure you would.
Pardon?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
What Hotel are you staying at?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
I think I will.
And are they going to get it?
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What are you going to do?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
...I'm going to need your help...
...I have to stand up for her...
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
They still have to take it to a jury.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
You use their witness.
The Hospital...?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I understand ...
What?
Who told you that?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
I did.
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
And you like it.
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Then?
From whom?
Someone dead.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
But you knew about this.
Nothing.
I -- I --
About three years.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Yes --
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Wherever you'd like...
Can't you see?
No!
Your accident...
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
You've nothing to apologize for.
No! No, thank you!
The oldest living things?
Why?
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
No, thank you.
When?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
What was it inside that told you to jump?
What do you remember?
Would you know the room?
How do you know?
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
Only this far.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
And it's a all real.
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
What is her name?
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
What.
My... the acrophobia.
Okay.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Yeah.
Do you know him well?
For what?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Did you need it?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Don't touch her. Call 911.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
She's dead.
I don't know why the floor was wet!
What did you say?
I have plenty of friends.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
You want to hear me out?
You don't know what you're doing.
What do you think you are doing?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Just stop.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
So that's what we're doing.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
What does that mean?
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
It has to be done.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
I'm not talking to you?
No.
Shut up.
What kind of words?
Shut up Boyd.
Say it again.
What?
I just want to get married.
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
My what?
The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!
Oh really? Starbucks?
New king.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
Give me the Valium.
How about my Fatburger?
Government cutbacks.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I think so.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
You expect more what?
It's vile!
Keith do not trivialize this.
So what do we do?
Go down where?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
No way.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
No.
Do you love me?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
So?
Come on.
I guess.
Where?
That's our plan.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
That's right.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
What about them?
You'll think you're still at the convent.
Who is she?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Only because you want it.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
Wasn't that cowardice?
Maybe ...
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
What's the matter?
She won't even know.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
But why? Why?
Nothing.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
Well... is it so urgent?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
He's lying through his ass!
There's been an accident.
You little liar! Get out of here!
Yes!
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
No, I don't want to.
Why wasn't I told?
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
But only you will know he's not human.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?
What about them?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I'm still making adjustments...
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
Glad to...
John died.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
How did you get your hand out?
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
What does that mean?
Stop me.
Tell him.
Part of him is.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>...
It's <u>producing</u>.
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Wilfred, that's not bad.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
...the Harvester... 
What are you talking about?
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost? 
...the... 
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Why?
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...what's the Long View?
Anything at the Airport?
...they just hadn't thought it through...
The War is Over.
Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
...Good...
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
What do we have that they want?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
Mmm.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.

We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
You got a dime....?
Naw, naw, we own the airways... 
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while.
...what is this?
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Don't start, alright.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
You sure?
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
Allright. Wait here...
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
How much is enough Gordon?
Dump it.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Where is it?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
Only if I want something bad enough.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
Well, why stop at that?
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
About what?  About us.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Would you like a closer look?
Thank you
Good evening sir.
They seemed, closing by much 
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
China
This. is killer.
Sell my soul?
Maybe before the event, never after.
They're all human beings
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
I'll come back all the time.
A ghost?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Then why did you?
No.
You're joking.
How do you know it's a she?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
I can't, no, no, I can't...
This fence...it's so...
Right.  I'm sorry.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
What?
It's fine.
She never mentioned her father.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
You got it.
Telling you...
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
I think so
Did I?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Mmm.
Is it gone?
Really?
That's...
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
I never said...
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
What are you...?  No.
But then you've been so much better...
Then where is she?
But I don't remember.
What's the matter?
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
How can you be sure?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
:Would you stop it!
But you've not told Michael.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
Help us.  Do what you can.
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
Always loved you..
You bastard...
It is from love.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
Rowan...
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
You still feel that crazy...?
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
That's not funny.
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
I don't know.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
Yes it is...
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
Sure...
You don't know?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
I don't know...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Why should I?
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
I am sorry...
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
Yes - of course.
I'll be sure to...
Yeah, whatever.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
God, I love being dead.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
You have changed since second grade.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
We own a small family grocery store.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you want me to do?
You mean they knew who I was?
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
I see.
And then what?
I know.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
Let's do it.
I'm trembling with excitement.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
But absolutely true.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
She still work there?
Maybe she used another name.
Lombardo's settlement?
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
Yeah... okay... he did
I'm sorry?
A ride.  You want one?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You're out of your mind.
I'm not on your property!
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Stick?
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Forget it.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You can't...
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Put Kelly on too.
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
No.
Funny.  So am I.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
All what?
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
There's only seventy-eight.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
And now the job's yours.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
He had a pressing engagement.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
That would be... the Mexican War?
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Yes!
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
In an hour they're gone!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Is this what's left of your army?
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Good.  How long will it take?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Friend of yours?
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
Ahhh!
Kill him!
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Why?
Shut up.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
John, why?...
I thought I was the English.
Have you got your gun on now?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
But why?
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
But Stoltzfus said...
I know what he said.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Johnny, what the fuck?
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
My son is out there!
No... No. It is just the English way.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
No --
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Yes.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
To see?
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Catch him, you fool!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Aw, come, come, come --
Did you say something?
My mouth -- my mouth!
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh --
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- does it hurt you?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Oh, scared, huh?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Hold still - hold still --
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
I want to see you and your wife right away....
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Ohhhhhh!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
To Oz!
Oh - look out.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
Made to look just like an accident.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Like riding a bike.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
Who did you get it from?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
Im sorry.
...you should rest.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
I thought you were the one in her business.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
A rope!
Where?
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Bond!
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Don't call me that.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 

That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Antarctica??
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
That's because --
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
What about you?
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
What weapons do you have?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Alright, so I'll get more.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
For what purpose?
I wanted to talk to you.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
What do you say?
I've seen a lot of rings.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
I'll go.
I felt like she almost killed me.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
The way what is going to be?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Victor Frankenstein.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
I did, sir.
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
Promise??
I promise.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
That's my good boy.
Yes!... the laboratory.
May I have it, please?
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
What hump?
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Must be the music room.
Could be raining!
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
Yes.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
What did you find out?
That's what we're paid for.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Inga, wake up!
Well, this explains the music.
A god?
I thought it was wonderful.
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
I think so.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, I know.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
