Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Let's go.
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Hopefully.
What's normal?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
In 9th.  For a month
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Why not?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Her favorite uncle
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Away.
You just said
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Are you lost?
We're not.
No fear.
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Were you in jail?
So what did I have an effect on ?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Something like that
You know what I mean
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
I didn't care about the money.
Because I like to torture you.
Which parts?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
See you next week!
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
You don't usually ask.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
No?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Call them.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Esdras is a Jew.
Passion is something one cannot control!
Damn God!
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
A woman?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
We can't be.
You think I don't know that?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then why?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Somewhere else?
What about back home?
What are you asking me?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Did you tell him you did?
No, what is it?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Watch the news?
I don't even watch TV.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Pretty.
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
How many victims are up there?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Promise?
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah.  I promise.
Thank you.
Keep them out of my way.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Is there a problem?
Okay.
You said speak Czech!
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Cut!
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
That's what it looks like to me.
But you knew that, right?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Right. Just a sec.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Are you reasonably awake?
Two more.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
In three days, darling, I hope.
How many days until you come home?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Are you quite sure?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I never paid for it in my life.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No chance.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Want to try it again?
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You have a good time?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
The bet's off.
Come on.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Yeah, I read the report...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
So am I.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Give it back.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
What kind of mission?
Good luck..
What is?
Yes. Of course..
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Do you love her?
...'Scuse me?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
He's on vacation.
Not without Leeloo.
I'll be right back.
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
Uh..you're welcome.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
It's difficult.
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Been here long?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
...What do you mean?
Amen..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Okay, I believe you.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
You don't understand...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Dino...
If it's not him, there's no deal.
Sure.
Bring the film, or we kill him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you!
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
It was a lot of fucking money.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Stop talking.
Where?  Show me where.
Easy enough for you.
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Shut your mouth and drive!
I'm asking.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Sounds good, pops.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Yes, but...
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
Who is this... ?
No... no... no...
No, sir, he is not.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Okay.  Fine.
Certainly, sir.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
What's wrong?
Kristen...
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't find him.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
Three days.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Who?
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Huh?
My name is...
Been having bad dreams.
She doesn't want me around
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
To take a picture.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Yeah...
I want to talk about the baby.
Faint.
Mark...
He invited me to his house last night.
My father!  He's not - ?
Yes?
But if they <u>do</u>?
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Seems to be all around...
I...don't know!
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
What????
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?
I'll be another!
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
Twombley involved?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Yeah. I know about that.
Chub says you're fired.
This spring.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Oh.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
You can't buy Wade off.
Wonderful!
Oh.
Shit.
Where'd you get the blood?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
I don't want to.
It's fun.
Yes.
Yes.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Fine.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
I figured you already heard.
Like hell.
It's just...
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Forget it.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Okay.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
There's a furnace.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
How's that?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
His office. You mean my old office.
He got his deer yet?
Call it what you want.
Crawl!
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Well, it was an accident.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Get some sleep.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Yeah. I forgot.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Then who shot him?
Back at The Fishbowl?
Some kids were teasing you?
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Lemme take a look.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Yes
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Hold on, Alice.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
We're under attack.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Thank you for calling the white House...
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
Other way around, sir.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
What's the story?
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Yes I did...
Accelerators down.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
That was very well put, Ted.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
That's my girl.
Yes, sir.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
You have great tits.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
What should I say?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Don't try to stop me!
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Surely there must be something you can do.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
I just don't want to go over it any more.
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
The gear is down.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
You promise you'll write.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Here.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
That's right.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Nice signal, dickwad!
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
How the hell do you know that?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Did you learn anything?
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
Was.  Divorced.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
In the other man's rectum.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
You understand that.  But how many others will?
Only holds five.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Don't tell me what to think.
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
If I go.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Forget it.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
On my way.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Seal the door.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Why not?
You promise?
You're really something, ace.
You mean dead.
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Look!
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
What are you talking about. What people?
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Why?
What did you think of the music?
Meaning you didn't like it.
What?
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
What are you talking about?
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Your father is dead.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Then he didn't send you?
What for?
Isn't it obvious?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
When, may I ask?
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Gertrude!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Well. There it is.
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
That's not what I hear.
How many pupils do you have?
Yes.
Yes.
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
No one calls you that.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Yes what?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Animals?
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
Why not?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
Of course not.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
You mean she's not coming back?
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Of course.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Oh, yes.
Common time.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
Show me.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Yes.
What for?
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
No, but I'm the best.
Who is on this committee?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
And do they believe it?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
My son, no one can speak for God.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
About the ballet.
I agree, Baron.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Bene.
I'll call tomorrow.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Is David acting strangely?
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Twenty-eight.
What? Oh, yes, please.
Now I'm embarrassed.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Very nice.
It's nice to see you.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David, stop!
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
I thought not.
I looked.
There's no call for that kind of language.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Where am I?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I don't know.
Okay.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Wrong.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
What was it?
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Yeah.
Plan?
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
David!
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
Will you be quiet?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
You don't have to say anything.
What about the zoo?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
I don't rightly know, sir.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Just pure luck!
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she
I haven't got it.
Why not?
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Well, what?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
I want to be near you!
Why, Cyril, you're insane
Cyril!
Hello, darling.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Why, I don't know.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
If he can do it, yes.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
All right.
Oh, is that so?
With what?
All right, dear.
Yes, why?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
There you are!
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
I'm okay, Matt.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Leave me alone, Bob.
What have you done?
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Two.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
She got two of them.
She was European!
Perfect, Cole.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
You're right, sir.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
So what was he?
Shush.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Sparkling rocks?
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Let me see that.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Swimming. Swimming is good.
That's the idea.
Yes?
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
I'm not hanged yet.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Move you fools!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Good.
Yes sir.
THEN WHO DID?!
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
I look forward to seeing it.
Sir?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
Vengeance.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
I can't.
You like it there, don't you?
Eight?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
What do you want, Courtney?
Take it off.
Maybe.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You and...Luis?
Nothing.
Would you like to see my apartment?
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Do...what.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
I know her. I knew her.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Lucky, I guess.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Jesus lives, Luis.
New card. What do you think?
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
Well...
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Yeah.
Okay. Do.
Paul Owen.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
No. I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
How old are you?
Thanks.
No problem. 
Well...
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
I'll be there.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Al.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
Isn't that -- extreme?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
...Different?
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Like I said: shot in the dark.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Gimme the coordinates?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Oh hi.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Definitely.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
You've been coming in early.
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
I mean, it's your life.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Why would you do a thing like --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
What about "60 Minutes."
Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Gary.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Please don't go.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
It's three years old, it --
Is that how Larry feels?
Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Thanks.
Thank you, Basil.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Thank you.
Yes, Basil?
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Man, you are one chilly square!
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Sure.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Let me see.
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
I couldn't have another bite.
Why?
I am not.
Not in the Nineties.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Sure.
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Yes.  Scott!
Dr. Evil?
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
Well, it's kind of weird.
... preserve...
So I'm still ...
You mean you don't recall??
There, look!
Impossible?
Eh? In here!
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
This isn't a game.
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
To kill me?
Winning isn't everything.
No idea who. No idea why ...
It's called Black Leather.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Who's now vanished.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Why?
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
You.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
I was at Harrow ...
I do.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
You're kidding.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Cole...
Five thousand dollars.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
So does Debbie.
She's mine!
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Let's have a toast.
What's going on?
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Yes.
That's it.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
It's all right...  So have I.
Then it's on to the real thing.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Right... Think it over.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
No.  I need a drink.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Just leave me alone, okay?
I know.
How do you know?
-- What were they doing there?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You're back.
I work for city hall.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Then why did you quit?
Uh huh.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
You could check. It'd be in his files.
You're right.
Then who --
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
No it couldn't.
And the putty around the door?
What reason?
Four months?
No need to be modest, Brian.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
What's wrong?
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
-- Burn them.
I might.
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator...
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
"The Strawberries"?
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
I forgive you.
Are you sure?
How 'bout...
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Well you did.
Give me some?
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Yeah, him.
What do I do?
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Damn skippy.
De-la-croix.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
Well do something about it.
Why?
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
What are there character traits?
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
It's been a long time.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
What do you want me to say?
Thanks.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Work related or otherwise?
Same thing Giuliani said.
In time.
What you did is dead wrong.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
We should go out on a double date.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
I never was more in earnest.
Neither!
What is the service, sir?
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your honor must lower his voice.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
But how, sir?
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
How so?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
The Prince left him only that choice.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Yes, he's fine.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Of course --
Do what?
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
What business?
Bullshit.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Well?
I didn't do anything --
I don't know --
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
What point?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
Are you sure?
Nah.
Good, just making sure.
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
What if I don't want it?
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
Oh, you remember now --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
What.
We're not going anywhere.
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
He's not Army, it's not official --
No --
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Yes.
I don't expect to.
Don.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
That's terrible.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
I can.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Okay.
What did he say?
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
What?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
The River!
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Is he going to be okay?
We rented a car.
Oh.  We are Russian.
I...
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
I don't want to talk about him.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Sometimes.
You didn't mind too much.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Not really. Maybe a little.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's dead.
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
Okay. Promise?
I'm sorry.
Maybe you will find out.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Yes?
Not if no one finds out.
You didn't have to do this.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
Okay.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Come on, gal...
How long... how long I been out?
Wait. He left.
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Uh-uh.
Let go of me...
Uh-uh.
We drinkin' buddies now?
Anything.
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Ask the chef.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
I do.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
What's on your mind?
Are you wasted?
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
You'll take care of that.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
San is an honorable title.
What...?  Why?
How many men?
I don't give tours.
I don't think so.
Unavailable.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
You met her.
I don't remember saying yes.
Who am I supposed to be?
Guess I'm on a roll.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Dope?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
He was my partner.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
You're androids.
Nexus - 6.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
What was he after?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Industrial refuse.
How do I stop one?
I think we're through for the night.
Do you have something against science?
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
These aren't just...
Nope.
You're going to be over the limit.
What did she want?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
I don't know nothing about it.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Yeah.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Because it's not.
The machine works.  She is.
What one?
Of course.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Come where?
Do you own a car?
And that's it?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
It's Perry!
Oh, I could die...
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Sure.
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Yes.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Of course.
Sure.
Well...yeah. Okay.
I like her.
No way.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
A card?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Uh-huh.
I love Lucy!
Really?  Since when?
She's right?!
Juneau.
True.
I just don't want to.
No.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Oh. I see.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
What?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old do I look?
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
The sky?  Where?
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
All back East.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
All our friends...
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
I told you! I've got everything!
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
If I...you know...
Coming!
You bet.
And I made these!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes...
Yes! That's right!
Mutants?!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
What are you doing here?
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
We did not leave together.
He didn't leave with them.
What?!!
Give it back to him.
We came back to the house!
Yeah. How's Dad?
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
It must be great.
Anything you can tell me?
Yes.
Why do you do it?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
No, not at all.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No.
Please, please stay.
I sure don't hate you.
Beeeee careful.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Do you love me?
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
Don? Where is he?
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
Hello, daddy.
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Good, let's drink up.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Yeah, I know.
Well.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
I don't know. He moved away.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Alright.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I'll drink to that.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Yeah.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Actually. I've been in twice.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey? Why?
Just some fatherly advice.
It's okay.
Yes.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Up where?
I need Il Duce.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
What are you saying?
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
You gotta keep going.
Connor, is that you?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
Know any other languages?
Aye.
How many?
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
No pictures, either.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
And he is one smart man.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
Rocco!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
The Greeks. The Italians.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Well, what'ya do?
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Y-Yes my son.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
You know them personally?
Yes.
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
What do you want me to say?
He's a nigger.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Eight dollars.
We got it. We got it.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
You were spoiled rotten.
They don't?
As long as he gets out OK.
He told you and you let him do it.
If you say so.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
She doesn't need to know.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
We've got sixteen dollars.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Right now.
He seems pretty good.
Bob!
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I don't think you will.
As a person?
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
There's not enough time.
How?
Dignan, I --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
What do you mean?
No, that door over there.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Why'd you want to help us?
See you, Bob.
Nobody does.
Is that OK?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Why do you say that?
Nothing. I was just asking.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
No.
Cuba.
Abdul-Shabazz?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
Good question.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
God DAMMIT.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
So it's my fault?
I don't know.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Yes, I do.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Let's go!
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Wait a second --
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'm trying.
He said you ran away from home.
Who? Applejack?
You got that?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Will it track back to us?
One last push. One.
I want to know about Treadstone.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
...this is Conklin's computer.
Do you know what his budget was?
You don't know what you're getting into here.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
No... It must have been Bourne.
Why not? It was just money.
Had to be done.
Okay... 
No, I do.
Yes...
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I don't know who that is.
I did.
I'm sorry.
Conklin up front.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
So...
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
Switch! You drive!
-- not yet --
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
What is this, a game?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
What do you mean?
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
I want to come in.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Are we hacking or asking?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
We must sue for peace.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
You mock us with a smile?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
You scare me.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
I... I don't remember.
Sure...
So you believe me?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Damn. Your dad did this?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Not if you remember my dad.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Because you're... different.
Yeah?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Evan Treborn.
Wow... read something.
Deal. Now read me something.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
I came with Captain Renault.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
What is your name?
I'm sorry. It is.
A champagne cocktail, please.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
No thanks, Carl.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
What do you want for Sam?
Practically no one.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Yes, something.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Everything is quite all right.
But Richard, no, I, I --
And I said I would never leave you.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Does he always leave so early?
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Of course, I'll be careful.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Your work.
We all try. You succeed.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
What of it?
My wife?
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
No. It's all arranged.
We'll be there.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
-- Thank you.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
I expected no less, Captain.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I see what you mean.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Victor Laszlo.
Manages what?
Oh, but I just told you. --
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Okay.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Uh huh.
I'm a drunkard.
Put that phone down!
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
For how long?
No.
Then don't have a drink.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Uh, my watch stopped.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
You've had today's water.
No.
Moon's too bright.
Fix raft first.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
No.
As much as anybody.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Had a package to deliver.
I've got lots of time.
I thought I did.
You want to.
Could you watch Jango?
There isn't any us.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I would never --
And how was your Christmas?
Which I didn't have.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
I most definitely say I am.
Let's eat.
I'm doing fine.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
For the third time.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
Want to see my raft?
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Forty-three days.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
I was!
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Better than I can!
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
Daddy, *please*...
Really?
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Okay...
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
Oh, sure!
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Why?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
He's leaving...
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Obviously.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Almost.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
We see you next harvest.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
And these cops? What do they get?
It's not true.
Guess so.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
I guess it lacks a certain style.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I apologize for the inconvenience.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Uh-huh.
Lighten up.
It's what I do. It's my job.
How do you know I will?
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
No, I want my cut!
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Do you have a ticket?
This is embarrassing.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
We're here.
You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
High five.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
No. Thanks.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
Not entirely.
Probably.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
No. Answer it!
You will?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Don't let yourself down.
Well, thank you anyway.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
Impossible to calculate.
Absolutely not.
I don't gamble.
I'll watch.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Robbery's not criminal?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Did you solve your problems?
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Who did it? Tell me!
Turn left at the lights.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I'll tell you later.
I was at Beadles.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
Any exceptions?
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
I can see.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
It didn't go off.
Well, there's the possibility of...
-- open quantum latches --
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
No.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Why don't you have more time?
That is correct.
Hmmm...
Who cares?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
It didn't work?
That's correct, sir.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
How come I never hearda you before?
None of your business.
You mean until you showed up?
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
You're roommates?
Police drone.
What?  Where're we going?
Don't look down.
It's a rule.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
I don't want to move away.
First time I ever heard that.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Logan Cale.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
I won't be staying.
It was open.
How well do you remember the lab?
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
You said you could help.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Oh?
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
A long time.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Please...
So are dogs.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
She's got my word.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Right, the big one-oh.
You left out condescending.
I'm the victim here.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
Lydia.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
And why should she?
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
Easy Sketchy.
Okay, okay, okay--
Say the words, "I understand."
I want you on call here.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Huh?
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
Oh, screw it!
What's it worth to you?
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
YO, DOOFUS!
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hawk?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
Go ahead, Jam.
Uhh... nothing.
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
No.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
What?
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
The KISS Army!
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
So... that's it?
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Like a spear.
I didn't say shit.
You know what? I think that you did it.
Who is... we?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Sure.
Yeah?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
What?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Maybe she's asleep.
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
It's safe here.
Who's Frank?
Yeah...
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Grandma Death.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
No. That makes you keep searching.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yes. I went to jail.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
When will this happen?
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
How did you know --
How did this happen?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Okay.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
Airport Ho-Jo!
I gotta work with these women.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
What?!
I love you much.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Hi.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
My dress'll reek.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
And the year before that?
Gladys! Stop it!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
All right, let's go.
Yeah.
What!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
"My dear"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
I don't call him, I whistle.
Yankee Poodle.
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
She did.
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
I can't do it...
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
Give me that again!
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
Two, please.
Oh, yes.
And here are my mother and father.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Did you see it?
Like this. 
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Oh, no.
You've never been?
Tell me about it, please!
Good morning.
Yes.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
Thank you very much.
Who are they of?
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
A dressing bag.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
HE'S GONE!
And who might you be, sir?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
And I thought you said it was something special...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
I will go and wake them up!
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Don't talk nonsense.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
I don't suppose... no...
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
Well... no...
He was lucky...  Sit there.
I've got you!
How about making friends?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
She MUST have a knife or something...
Same thing, isn't it?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
I... I...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
You'll drown us bo...
You fool!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
Neither am I.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I remember.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Here we are.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Why?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
It's okay, really.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I'm sure you would.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
You know Wilmont?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
I like to read.
It's pretty.
No, I'm okay for now.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Yeah.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
When?
Tomorrow?
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I don't know.
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
I'm sure, I said.
I did it. I guess that means something.
Yeah?
Hi.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
I know.
What do we do?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Yeah.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Fuck you, Clementine.
It's too late.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
'Night.
I better do this, Stan.
Well, what should we do?
Hi.
What do you want, Stan?
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Just wanted to let you know.
Jesus, Patrick!
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Well.... er...
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
You're the best?
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
Tired...
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
"Another man?" Who?
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
What happened?
90 over 50 and falling... .
He's crashing...
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
The dark inside me.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Frozen.
Skipper...
Justin.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Negative.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Son of a bitch!
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Get out of there now!
Radiation interference?
Oxygen is not the problem.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
There's no one here.
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I mean...
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think? With Sue.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Reed?... Sue?
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
So are you!
What about you?
Ben, are you there?
Okay, "mom."
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
And reverse the mutations --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Reed, we're running out of time.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
All right!!
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
It's the first door on your left!
This is how I dress all the time.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Where did you hear that?
Why?
I didn't say that.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
No.
All right, then. It's your secret.
Okay, Dennis.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Yes, sir.
Dad says!
What a guy.
Mark is a really nice boy...
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
All right, I take it back.
It's definitely your mama.
Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
How often do you go?
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Totally.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
I can't do that.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
What?
That little prick.
What do you want?
He's not coming.
Sometime?
Yes.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I don't know. I guess so.
Where do you feel like going?
We keep them.
Sure thing.
I've heard that, too.
Naw. I don't mind.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Do you really have to go?
John Bonham?
Two Cokes.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Well, thank you.
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Not where we operate.
WHAT?
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
You whore!
Lacerda?
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Not much. Why?
He told me he was turning in early...
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
How about a check?
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
NO! Stop talking like that.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Lucy is looking for you.
No, she's looking for you.
It's gone too far.
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Right.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
Gonna stay for a couple?
Anyone.
And the head?
Easy.
What's it for?
Shit!
Your parents of relation?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Seven.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Gimme the keys.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Oh...
I just hit it like you said.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Oh. I mean, good.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
No, I'm concerned with everything.
...acts. I'll relay your message.
I'm not!
Huh.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
Right now we have to be practical.
GET OUT!
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
You want his name?
Thank you.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Address?
Occupation?
...Not if I can help it.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Quietly.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Is that why you did it?
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Who said I was a lady?
That's right.
...Take advantage of me.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Frances, You're crazy.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
I don't care.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
What?
I was watching.
What kindness?
The music? Or the fire?
Friends? Do they live around here?
I am afraid.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
A brain. Extremities.
There, there... shhh...
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
They'll hang him all the same.
No. He had more important work.
Is that your diagnosis?
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
Despite the lack of challenge.
Victor, explain yourself.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Madness?
I will protect you.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Sure.
Artist.
It sounded like Brenda.
You're welcome.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Is it stuck?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Whassamatta?
Sure.
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Have you ever been there before?
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
I have no idea.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Yes, she is.
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
What are you going to do?
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Where are you taking us?
What you said to me in the room.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
What?
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's what you look like.
Where are you right now?
Where are you?
Yeah.
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Don't say my name.
What'd you find, Kathy?
Of course, but there's more --
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Didn't take long.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Smoke her.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Uh, question, ma'am.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
You'll think about my offer?
I oughtta report you.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
I saw an article...
Yeah.  Me too.
Well, now I feel so much better.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Last time I didn't.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
15, sir.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
MOVE!
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I take it this file is still open.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
But we can get to the west side faster.
You must have quite some harem.
You'd be surprised.
Nick Tatopoulos.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Can I use some?
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
That is when we will go in.
Follow me.
You're standing on it.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
Thanks.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Open.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
Down there.
No I didn't.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
What do you mean?
How did you come to that conclusion?
Shit! Go!
GO Commander.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Something BAD happened here.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Your last name.
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Right.
Mark 12.
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
I don't know.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Push It. Hold it down.
Okay, let's go.
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
It is.
You go too far, Benedict.
What?  What are you talking about?
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
But it's more than just that, am I right?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
How can you say that?
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
I... they look both the same.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Well, we must be who we must be...
I think I will disappoint you.
Voltaire, of course...
Who says so?
Juba was a Numidian.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Who?
No. What's this?
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
About sixty.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Get something going there.
I can't do it.
That's the magic number.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
That's correct. Look at me.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I'm in the movie business.
You have a card in here?
Leo spanked a waitress?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
Really? You ever been arrested?
One of his best parts.
What do you get out of this?
I had to tell 'em something.
Never say anything unless you have to.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Who?
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
I'm thinking of a movie.
One we're producing.
I'm looking at you.
Compass.
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
Here's another tip...
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
For any movie.
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
I want to know.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
What happened?
You're as bad as Harry...
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Harry -
I'm going.
Chili and me.
Mob guy?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Gimme a break.
A what?
Yeah, yeah.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
I think you better see this for yourself.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
I bet you did.
Too big. More like a freighter.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Only way to be.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
What?
If it was a ship she hit.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
Victims of what?
Over the gold.
What?
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Yeah.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Lost my sea legs.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Give up?
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
Did you actually do this painting?
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
Huh?
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
I figured something like that...
What do you mean "why"?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hey Josh.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
In fact, never.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I don't believe you.
Just now... I went with Seymour.
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
You're gross.  See that guy?
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
You're insane.
So where's all your stuff?
Maybe an orange juice.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
Seymour does.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
Indian records?
I'm totally serious!
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Shh!
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
What about Joe?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
I dunno, I...
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
Yes?
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Yes he is.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
That's what the books say... 
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
Was that supposed to make me feel better? 
Good luck.
The workers don't get on?
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Occasionally
Didn't I do it?
That's exactly what you said last week.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Or we could do that.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I know.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
Do I?
Like what?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
What's the reading?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
I'll get one more reading.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
She's new in town.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Thanks.  What's in there?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
All right.  What do you want to do?
Don't scream.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Can't you tell me now?
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Talk to my accountant. 
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
Yes, it would.
A square?
Good guess -- but no.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Wow!
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
God, it's ugly!
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Do you believe in God?
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
What is that... wailing?
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Caesar?
Until your confirmation date.
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
You don't know how wrong you are.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
As soon as I can.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I don't want you to die!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
Chain him.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Alive... I'm alive...
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Hello.
Yes.
No.
But, Elaine --
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Okay.
Because I want to know what's happening.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Yes.
Is it because I'm here?
All right then! Yes!
Don't you have it on?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
What?
I might.
Yes.
Tomorrow?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Shhhh.
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Are you listening?
Yes, I will.
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
No, sir.
I want you out of here.
It's in the main ballroom.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
What? No. Nothing.
Where is your luggage?
That's right.
Will you take me home?
No. 
Let's go.
Right.
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Sit down.
What if he did?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Well -- I don't know.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Are you afraid of me?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you really want me to?
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Not exactly.
Yes.
Art.
I don't think we were the first.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
No.
I wouldn't know.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Did I say that?
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I don't think so.
Very good, sir.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
When I go off?
Well, wait.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
That has nothing to do with it --
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Ben, can I say something to you?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
But why?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Yes, I can.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
With the pearls?
I have an idea working in my head... 
Dictation.  You know...
What?
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Yes -- I'd love to.
You live here?
For tonight. 
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Why do you hide in my room?
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
How tired you are!
And...?
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Yes -- I do understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
What?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks. 
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
What?
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Oh yes, of course.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Movies?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Perhaps. 
Have you got it now?
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Here, hold up!
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Again?
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
You are late. Hurry.
No news yet?
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
What do you want with her?
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Motherhood.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
And if you do it wrong?
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
Lead on.
No?
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Don't mention it.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
No.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
In your other hand.
You already went back to work.
The long end. Big con.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
He retired.
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
Sure.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
Yes?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
Not many.
No blood on the knife.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Funny, we just drove right in.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
No shit?!
Just forget it...
Where'd you get it?
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Bye Will.
Shit happens.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Shit, Linda!
Thanks!
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
It's not working!
Or what's left of him.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
Why did you take Jamie?
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
Hm?
A bitch.
We've never met.
We'll see.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Must have changed that law.
At least!
Tell them yourself!
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
I'm liable to find anything!
Let's talk about it some other time.
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
Months?
Let's talk about something else.
You told me.
When?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
What's this?
In what way, pray tell?
You did?
I don't think so.  It could have been.
That can be arranged.
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
To make an ass of yourself.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Gee whiz--
You're hollow, like a woman.
Sir?
Are you--
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
College?
It makes life spicy.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Oh hell.
Wow.
I don't know.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
What do you do for a living?
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Nothing would please me more.
Say hello to your mother.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
People don't use that word any more.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Such as?...
And he keeps it in his apartment?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
No you're not!
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Almost a Christmas scene.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Blue soup?
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
If he thinks he's man enough.
I plan to live one hundred years!
Honor, I suppose.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
No.
Don't!
There it is.  Give it to me.
You've killed women?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
It's always locked.
Hello, Mother.
Oh dear.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
I've got to run!
What a brilliant diagnosis!
You have chills?
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
You were wrong, you quack!
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
I'm high as a kite.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
You hope.
I see.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
Don't shoot.
I've enjoyed being man.
Leave the rifle here.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Don't!
Oh, Paul--
Thank you, kind sir.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
Not true.
How did she lose her feet?
I don't really know.
For Heaven's sakes!
That man is your father.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
He can hardly talk.
Yeah.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
Something happens to my confidence.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Far as I know.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
What?
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
Penelope!  We're late!
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
He died of a massive rupture.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
You'll be fine.
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
Pull out your cock.
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Sam?
Are you sure it's all right?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Do you know where she would be?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
Ulcers.
No.
Of Joanne's?
They were here?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
You wife isn't dead is she?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
And better?
What's it called?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
But the police...
The police? They know less than you do.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Pretty good.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Who told you about this?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Okay.
Good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
In other words, you want to get laid?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
No.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Officer, I can explain.
Check.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Harold Chasen.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Yes.
Yearse!
Certainly a new experience for me.
What?
But this is public property.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Well, I don't...
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
I like you, Maude.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Where's that?
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Yes. They're old friends.
Maude.
Here.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I wouldn't say "benefit."
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Ah, yes.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
What else do you like?
No.
Your studies?
You think so, sir?
Yes.
Well, I don't...
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Yes.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
We've always been here.
We have no more surprises.
I know.
WHY?
Finish what?
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Story of my life.
You mean, outside... with her.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I think that is its hand.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
He's just going through a phase --
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
Got tired of me?
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
Those things never work. Never.
Myers?
Well good n-
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
He's just pushy.
What about you?
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
It'll go in.
It's just a puzzle box.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
You did this before, right?
No. That wasn't the deal.
No.
This isn't happening.
Some things have to be endured...
I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --
Forget him.
Sure you are.
A box?
Let me see.
You would be. They tore me apart.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
I don't.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
Hi. I got soaked.
I saw everything.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
Like who?
It's just been empty a while.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
You're NOT going to faint.
I'm going to throw up.
No, you're not.
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
I've seen worse.
No. I'll do it.
Don't go upstairs.
Drinking alone.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Do you care ?
No, not much.
That's right.
Am I?
I won't be a moment.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Try me.
Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.
I will. See you.
Never better. You sleep well.
Of course.
I don't believe it.
No you don't.
All right.  No. That's nice.
She's so damn... English.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
We'll do it next Monday.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
Terrific.
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
No.  We need the gig.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
I have a television.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
That's what I said.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Yeah.  Great.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Is that the last of it?
Hey, how ya doin'?
I can't talk right now.
Uh... No.
You're also an idiot.
What?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
What about Ian?
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Mission accomplished.
You know the difference.
Oh, great...
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Harder.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
Well she --
What difference does it make?
Enough of what?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Everything go alright?
Nor have you!
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Good.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
I knew this was going to happen.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
No, we...
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Huh?
Happy birthday.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Does Carl Smith?
He called you "MacLeod".
You are.  Now.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
You want me to front for you.
It's beautiful.
A little dusty.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
There are differences.
I haven't killed _you_.
Will I see you again?
Yes.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
All fashionably without heads.
Spare me the details.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
What are you doing man?
-Et lux perpetua-
You're not from these parts.
Please go to no trouble.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
You feel you know me.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Like you.
Kiss me.
Second musketeer.
We have no understanding.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Figure she's with him?
You'd think he'd had practice.
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
You're insane.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Did you know the victim?
It doesn't.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
He's mistaken.
Do you?
You're a kind man to be sure.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
I'll send them right up.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
The power of the press, huh!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
I notice you still remember it.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Listen, Walter --
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
What do you mean?
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
All the words you've got.
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Murder, uh?
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Then why are you doing it?
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
I think it is.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
What?
What went off?
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Now what do you say?
Throw him out, Frank.
What did you do with her?
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
No -- what?
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I won't, Earl. 
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
What do you mean?
Huh?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Forty dollars.
The City Sealer's office!
But how do I know...?
You're insane!
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
Very well, Grandpa.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Who with?
...and six...
Who pays for them?
Where?
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
How are we going to cope?
Wasn't it lovely?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Look after yourself, Grace.
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Huh... what cone?
No, I told you...
Well, yeah, kind of.
That's not something to joke about.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
OK, Boss.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Yeah, showtime for what?
It's a girl.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
What?
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Oh, yeah.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
When you were outside with Bill.
I resign.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
No, just a little too old.
Sorry.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Let's go see.
Who's your Daddy!
Shit... fuck procedure.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Right.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
That must be him.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
We found one.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Like father, like son.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I've moved on.
That's not how he tells it.
I don't know. Something's missing.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
No.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
One night stand?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
With pleasure.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Shut up, you.
You've got to respect that.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
We are animals after all.
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
You do?
Do you?
What SPF, sweetie?
I love you so much.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Good. Making progress.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
That was wonderful!
Should I come with?
Yes.
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Oook. Oook.
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Unn.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Yes.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You ever played billiards before?
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
Sit down.
Poker's not your game.
Pool.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
A thousand.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Why?
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
When do I raise the bet?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Yeah, that's right.
Want some free advice?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
I don't want it.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
You don't need a drink.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
A son.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Aw, Eddie.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. Sure.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Mm hmm.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Raw.
Well, what else does?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Oh, grow up.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
He went off someplace.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
You're not them.
Yes.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
It was so real, Dad.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
Where, Jimmy?
I don't see anything.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
What happened to your other slipper?
The back door was open.
I have school.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
What's his family background?
Why, yes.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
Connie, don't hang up.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
So sue me.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
What's the bad news?
What're you talking about?
I'm thinking.
They don't know this.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
You try Martin?
Moishe, please, don't talk.
This I can see.
Oh shit, we're late.
Great.
You as well.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Really? You don't mind?
Dick-weed!
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Sorry for what?
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I hear you.
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
You sure?
We're leaving.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Here... now.
Peace? No peace.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
That was our assessment as well.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
Find something?
Pretty sure.
What?
I said don't go between them!
It's important!
Right.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
Well, uh...
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
What???
Dad!
Dad!
Booby traps?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Thanks.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man is humble...
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
I don't need camels.
You think so?
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
That was a misunderstanding.
Step on it, Short Round!
Okay, Shorty.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
What does the writing say?
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
Don't catch cold.
Dr. Jones?
I'm not leaving without those stones.
Yes, they believe you.
No... they won't kill me.
I'm going to puke in it...
Willie, come on!
You're not gonna believe this...
I'm...inside you.
This candid camera?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we now?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
You're gonna explain.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Why? AL  You know too much.
With Authority!
The man.
Gone where?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
We get on which plane?
I can't do that.
The beach?
...Just beautiful.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Swim.
You eat it.
What? What do you mean?
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
What are you looking at?
What glasses.
Are you serious?
How do you know?
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
I told you, I have a feeling...
You have to! Quickly!
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Cash.
And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Where've you been?
I have been... I think you're right.
About what?
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
Oh no!
I'll get us out of here.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Let us get to the border!
ya hyutn slulptsa?
Rene?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Join us.
Yes. Joe.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Who...are you?
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
Why?
...and sort of...disinterest.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
You did.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Is that Ryuji?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
No.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Oh sure.
And you?
I asked him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
That I really don't know.
Now what?
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Why?
Nothing we can do.
You're gonna laugh.
Now what?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
It doesn't hurt.
Hi, Daddy.
Three hours.
What? Forget it.
Yeah. Catch you later.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Oh, I love that stuff.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
...my files! Personal correspondence...
Okay. 
Yes, it's on the stove...
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
Hello? Yeah...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
All right. See you...
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
I think it was a disgrace.
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
How have you liked your stay?
Fuck you, too!
Why am I gonna mention your name?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
You called me.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
There is -- there is no family.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You're gonna get your fix...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Poor communication skills.
It acts as a drug on the body?
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
After you, Doll.
Excuse me?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
You want Botox?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Yes?
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
Yes.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
But you don't agree?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
No. I haven't. Have you?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
And you've always loved him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
He's passionate.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
No, we're not!
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?
Do you want to sleep on it?
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
What kind of "stuff?"
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
No buts. Now. Out.
It's okay Joe.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Oh brother. Here we go.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
I don't have a pre-nup
And it's good!
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
But then... But then...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
You're a peculiar chap.
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Fine man to fall in love with.
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
I don't want it reported!
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
That's right. You didn't.
Beat it! 
Not at all. 
Like what?
Nope. No complaints.
Yeah?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Thanks, professor.
What are you talking about?
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
It takes money to buy food.
Why, haven't you?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
This isn't "piggy-back."
Yes.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
was so scaredthat it scared
What for?
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Come on! come on! 
A black eye. 
That's swell!
Yeah, swell.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
But can't you wait until morning
Get out!
I said, the old man's screwy!
Up yonder. See the lights?
Thanks.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Well, I got it, Joe.
Well, I'll be
A trumpet?
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Who?
Yeah.
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
What?
I can use a smart guy like you.
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
Did he pay?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Yeah, I guess you do.
No, I'm not...
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Gee, thanks boss.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
No, I did not.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
A Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
Nonsense.  What next?
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
How many men?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Splendid, love to see them.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
I understand.
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I'll call her.
You.
Go ahead.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to make a deal.
What time do you have to be there?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
Thanks.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Who do you think I am?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
I am, as a matter of fact.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Black's fine.
Yeah.
Are you?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
Catching a movie.
They seem to like the idea.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Where's the rest of it?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
I thought you were tired of your business?
No.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
I'm sure that was the idea.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
I never have. It's not my money.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Not in the fitting room.
If it'll make you happy.
So what happens now?
I knew it.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
All your money's in Mexico.
It's true, isn't it?
I don't know. One of your friends.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
No, I give it to someone else first.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
Sure.
Really, I'm impressed.
What's a Metrix?
It's a diet thing?
Yeah.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Who's arm is that?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Uh-huh?
Okay, Lou-is.
Who's your partner?
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
I dunno.
What did he do?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Sure.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
She believed you?
What does that mean?
You couldn't just hit her?
Uh-huh.
Pretty sure.
In the chest and stomach.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Fuck you for asking me that.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Livingston, huh?
Haven't a clue.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Yes.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
You expect me to just walk in there?
You better be, motherfucker.
'Ola!
He leave town?
Take me home.
No! Oh God.
What do you want?
I'm okay.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
It's hard to explain.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Used you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Why do you say that?
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Hell, you think I am?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
Gee, thanks a lot.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
I don't know.
Who? Jed?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Yeah, but for what?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
We're at Della's.
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
That's your decision.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
What's gotten into you?
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down, Jake.
I don't know you.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
You look upset.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Shows how much you knew.
Never?
I don't know what to say.
We're not going to hurt you.
He'll never make it.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
I'm awake?
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Nothin' much.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
I just need to talk.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Why not?
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
A car accident.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
You got lucky.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Could you show a little compassion?!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
And now we're all out of it.
I am an expert!
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
My job.
You got that right.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Not so bad.
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
We're screwed.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Thank you.
Small brains make your balls itch?
That ought'a help the situation.
Oh my God! Adrienne?
You need to get laid!
Oh, alright.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
30? How long was I out?
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
What?
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
Have you ever had one do this?
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Let's all have a drink.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
It's a whale out there.
Think the tide's with us?
Think she might've run out on you?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
He's under!
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I'm supposed to be running.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I'll try to drop by later.
I miss it too.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
I try really hard, actually...
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Can we make out now?
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Blood and guts.
You weren't even alive!
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Oh.
No, he's the dad.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
You're something else.
Why? What the big deal?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Go learn something.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What are you?
No?
What's the matter?
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Sure.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh really?
Nothing...
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Only the one in my pants.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Share the love, Tits!
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
...Thank you.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Carryin' a gun.
What?
What'll we do out there?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
You wanna hear mine?
Nah... how much money have you got?
If you say so.
Damn right I do.
...I do.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Lighten up...
Fuck!
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
What are you going to do?
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
No, never. Excuse me.
...You're hurting me...
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Were they wearing condoms?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Right.
Yep.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Why I do what?
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
You are?
Casper, where is he?
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Nothen' B.
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
Yeah me too.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Hold on.
You have?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Do you care about me?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
What?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Everything is wrong.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Yeah?
It's like...
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
But then I won't need your money.
All right.
Hello?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
No, I need the original note.
You're a lying bastard!
Get off me!
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
Maybe he's going to drug her?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
By that time the game will be over.
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
You don't understand.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Fuck off!
Come here.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
Anything else?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
What does that mean?
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
Are we going to go through this again?
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
About what?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Sounds very violent.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
This isn't a game.
How can you look at it so clinically?
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
She died in a car accident.
It was.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
What?  By attacking me?
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
You.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Can I come in?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
It could be anything.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
I don't know how.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
All directions are the same here.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
You won't have to.
I will find her!
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot betray my bride.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
Staying alive.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
Not sleepy, either?
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Yes, my lord.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
No.
Sugarballs?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I don't think it's working.
You had better manners as a pig.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
A match for your son, I think.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Many have perished in that maze.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Her name is Death.
She had another name once.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
She was not as beautiful.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Why do you want to know?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Huh... 500 meters?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
You were scared, weren't you?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Mathilda, stop, please!
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
Yes.
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
I have no fear.
...Composer.
Yes... Twice.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
May we have this wolf's name and address?
For a walk.  I don't know.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
I won't let you die.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
You need a ride, Preacher?
That's enough.
You have?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
Don't be so sure.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Yes.
Where?
Walking where?
I told you.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
Don't do this.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
Evening News?
What do you think I should get?
...Noooo.
Coffee?
Sparkling apple cider?
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Will you lighten up, please?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
How much, do you think?
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Sort of.
How?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Is everything okay?
Yes, I am.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Definitely! I love him!
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
I know. He has it sent out.
Yes, you are.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Picking out my wedding dress!
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
Neat.
But maybe it's not what you think.
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
I can't.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
What?!
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
I'm quitting.
Is he the only one?
I do.
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
I guess it'll have to...
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
You go where?
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
Well, yeah, but --
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Why do you say that?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Where's the Rock?
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
You go to lady now?
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Might we watch, too?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Who might these friends be?
Gump, is it?
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
I fear she's lost.
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
What do I do?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
Knaves and robbers...
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Good plan that.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
We'll find it.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
What magic have we on our side?
Sapphire!
You're on your own... like a true champion.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
That's it then... the ring!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Three cheers for our champion.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Jack!
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Who?
They tricked you.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Tis the truth.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Then, perchance you'll me.
You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight?
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
What became of the princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
And sweet?
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
We wait.
I think she's about to foal.
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
What color?
Red.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
I thought I was helping you.
Are you afraid of heights?
He's got a standing invitation.
What are you on?
Maybe that's too long.
Thank you.
Uh huh.
I'm sorry.
Not a shower.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I did warn you.
Because I live there.
Mom...please.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
Hey...hey!
When are you going to be back?
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
No.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Good for you.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Thanks for telling me.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
God, you look like crap, George.
Oh.  Sorry.
Because Dad left?
Where he always is.
Why would they tow your truck?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Finished or unfinished?
You're not well.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I need to know.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Left you?
You got any weed?
His father is a man.
No.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
Yeah.
No, nigger.
Nigger.
That's my girl.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
But you can't.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Still got that ten dollars?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
What are you talking about?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
I'm sure it don't.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
What'd you say?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Let me see that.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
I'm not working on a plan.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Go where, Ray?
It's too late for plans.
I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
They gave me life, mama.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
I prefer bourbon.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
You shouldn't have come here.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Absolutely not.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
I'm calling you out, brother...
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
That pain is hunger.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Well, let's rock and roll.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I think you're looking at him.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Everything's fine, pop.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
You got it.
I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Why are you laughing?
I think I'm floating.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
..."The Devil?"...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Anything to eat?
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
I am.
Your own work?
Just the face.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
Why did you do that???!!!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
He was killed.
Curious.
I'm not armed.  Well?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
We can't. We're going back.
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
And Sanctuary?
Beloved wife...
No.
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
I don't know... but it does.
What's that?
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
It's all right with me. Is he here?
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
All right.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
What do you mean by that?
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
It's me...
Me, too.
I don't know.
Okay.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
You killed him.
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
Did you tell the police this?
No... Here he comes.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
Nothin'.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
The first night... Not the last two.
No, no. I want to go in.
That's absurd.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
That's why I married you.
Maybe.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Which would you choose?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
I can see that.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Yeah.
You want some company?
Sorry... I...
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Sheila?!
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Thank you.
I see.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Yes!
Will you stop squawking!
Sounds like a stall to me.
Just call me Barney.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Huh?
All right.
Nothing. Why?
Goodness, no!
Oh, yes.
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
You have no disputes over women?
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Yes.
What is it, my son?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Yes.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
See that spot?
Did I say "if"?
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Is that all my story meant to you?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Yes.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Actually, sir--
Kay, I'm sorry...
Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
You don't know the half of it.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
How does that help me?
Kay.  All I'm saying--
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Out of focus?
Yeah ... ?
No.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
It's... coming.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Come again?
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
The what?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Wait-- listen--
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Where's he making his big speech?
Oh shit!
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
What?
What is it?
Anderton --
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
It's all I could safely move.
Oh, yes.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
You set your patients on fire!
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
Kill type?
Drowning.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
Hang on, Lamar --
Tuck in your shirt.
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
Can you fake the cerebral output?
Now look at him...
You mind if I tag along?
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
So now I need you to hack into her.
Uh, I'll try...
That's great.
It's a little late for that.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
We know why John was tagged.
My God...
What?
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
None.  This was arranged.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
Knott!
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Yes.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
What was it then?
Yeah.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
We're in Fashion.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
No more.
She's, uh, sleeping.
I want spaghettis.
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
I'll support you.
With what?
Your dance is over.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Ruiz tied in out there?
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
A million. Easy.
So, that's it. I'm out?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
No.
Yeah.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Yeah.
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Good morning.
Tom, the Welsh dude --
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
No. That's cool, man.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Yeah.
He's not here.
What about it?
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Ask if he said anything to her.
He didn't say we need guns.
Sorry coach.
Fuck him.
She really liked the kitchen.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Oh really. Why's that?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Nothing else.
Nothing.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
Don't even start.
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
He woulda told us right?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 
What's up?
We're not getting whacked.
The penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
You're out of money?
Eighty bucks?!?
You did?
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Yeah. I want it.
The line's over there.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
How much is what?
The videos.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
No?
Coke?
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
We're square.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Keys.
Yes.
But, Max --
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Edinburgh.
A rose by any other name would --
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
I like you, country.
Just now.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
Now.
What you say?
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Okay, okay.
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Where am I gonna start?
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
Are you?
How do you know?
I'm not made of glass.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
I don't think we know for certain.
Allah Akbar.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
Say what you're saying.
I say a lot of things.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
500.
What does Sidney say?
Shorty, this is Laura.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I'm the man.
Am I a suspect?
[I'm on to Juarez.]
It's a little late.
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[I believe you.]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
It's loaded.
I drink.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
Different door. Not far from here.
I'm looking for potential.
I'm not crying.
I go to school, don't I?
Everywhere!
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
You feel sorry for the husband?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Did you used to?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
You think too much?
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
She understands men.
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
Hmm?
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[A beautiful circle.]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
What for?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
She wasn't so bad.
I came to see you. How you feel?
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
When was this?
What they say?
It pains that they should do this.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Catherine, my sister...
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Yeah.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
Marty...
Nothing.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
All right.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Goodnight.
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
Where you going now?
I'll see you.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
You gotta good heart.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Sure.
What didn't you like about her?
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Waddaya talking about?!!
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Not enough to be a pro.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
What the hell's going on here?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
What's that?
And it's the ninth inning.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Same here. You can retire my number.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Radar!
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Maria...
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
Second pint.
They missed the boat.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
What's the story?
Homosexuality.
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah, maybe.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
You got me.
Uh-huh . . .
Yeah, that's the one.
Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
The Websters!
You bet I will, Ma.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
No.
Have you seen him?
Where's Connell?
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
The heelots!
Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
It must be some kind of a gag.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
John Doe Club?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Whyuh
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Yes! I was paid! But the
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
I don't know.
Not that we know of.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Am I gettin' the car?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
I have to go face to face.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
For now that's all.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
So what do I say to this guy?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Get good at it.
Yes.
Yes.
That's okay. That's his style.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
So what do you want to do?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Stay put.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
My name's Scott Roper.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Yeah that's it.
It's very nice.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
Scott...
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Define concern.
Your concern is heartwarming.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
Who's running it!
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
About what?
True.  But why?
No.
Not real?
And what about the reconfiguration?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
Go!
And you weren't involved.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Good question.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Night City.
Corporation can.
Why not?
Checking connection.
Resurrection.
Speed?
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
Ah... sure.
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
... We must try to communicate with them.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
Ryan's Comet!!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
LET'S FLY!
There's enough for everybody!
A real shame.
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
The goddamned bastards.
No. Not everything.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Scared.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
But if ya can't catch the guys...
Who hired the bastard?
Long as Charlie says.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
That's it.
I can just imagine.
No. I'm here with you.
I'm already late.
Something came up.
You're sure?
Guess I'm too confused to think.
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
Who'll make the rules?
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Who?
What's your problem?
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
See if these two are my friends.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
But that's an hour's drive.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Kill them! Kill them!
This is nice. I mean it.
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Sad commentary, huh?
<u>Why</u>??
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
How much?
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Why?
Uh huh. And?
Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
I need a new PR guy.
I might wake up.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
When'd you get in?
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Aaron?
Mm hmm.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
... Manly?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Yeah.
You mean it's dangerous?
This way?
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
Yes. Mostly "Puss."  Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play.
What do I play?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Yeah. Funny--
Okay. You don't mind?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Is the wind tired out there?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
No--not offhand--
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
What is it?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
We're waiting, Hubert.
Nonsense.
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Me! Jim--how--?
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
What stuff?
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Certainly. Step right in.
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
Look! There it is!
For a question!
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Did you say--bus?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Oh, just a day--
Why?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Good. Where are we?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
No.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
Go right ahead.
Abigail.
Letitia.
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
But--I've done everything I--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Oh--Saunders--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Hurray!
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Swell!
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
No?
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
What do you mean?
Well--me, too!
What are you talking about? What difference--?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Senator Paine.
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Uh-huh.
Next, please.
Why not?
Were you present when all these things took place?
Yes, but I
You are , aren't you?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Yes.
We'll send for the police!
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Mr. Cedar!
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
You're going to New York with us.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
That's funny. Why is that?
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Ja.
It takes so long to detect them  because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
A child? My uncle's?
Huh?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
South Dakota - north?
Yeah. What?
Is Mary home?
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
What's that?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
You have no pants, sir.
But she's on the telephone
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
No!  What do you want!!
Me more than most.
Uh-huh. What are they?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
You must have been concerned.
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Were you supposed to have a session?
A friend?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
My approach?
How do you mean?
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
And the experiment is in here?
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
What?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
What?
It was Henry Follett.
You like me. How come?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Where am I supposed to eat?
He told you.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
-- Go on!
I don't know. I barely made it today.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Maybe you'll catch it.
Sorry... I'm done.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Uh-huh.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
That's what I like.
I don't follow you.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Hello.
It's a big part of the show.
It's called pro bono.
Where was this?
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
He agreed?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
I've got three big ones.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Uh-huh.
Yep.
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Sounds like you have several.
That'd be Lily.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
See you Thursday... regular time.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
What?
Yep.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
What friend? You're my only friend.
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
Intestines.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
To be hanged.
I am an English woman.
Proceed!
Fifty percent.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Trust me.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Did you ever see him eat?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
Do I?
What did he mean?
Sure.
Thanks.
He's dead.
Get on to yourself!
Think positive.
Captain who?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
You're dead.
You underestimate yourself.
Remember the cat.
Not tonight. 
Alone tonight?
Why?
It is?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
But I just don't feel it.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
It is?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Shut up.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
It's suicide.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
I'm glad you like it.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
About 5,000 troops.
Any cannon?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
No, sire... I was asleep.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
Why didn't you wake me then?
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
That is correct.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
I'll have the fire built up.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Lisette.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Are you trying to insult me?
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Five minutes.
Yes?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
And where do you place Alexander?
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Yes you did.
Can I look for myself?
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
That ain't gonna work.
How you know?  It could be anything.
What's the B-G's?
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
No, man, just wait.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
It's locked.
Make sure.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
I saw it.
Yeah, pops!
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Why did he go in the house?
Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.
This is a knock.
Call me.
20 minutes?
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
What happened here?
I've been a bad boy.
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
My security people are right next door.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
Who did?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
You fucked up.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
But...
All right.
No, kisses to...
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
Oh, man...
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Kill the Governor.
So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
What are you going to do?
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
It goes in that little hole.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Keep your eyes peeled.
What about them?
Where?
I kill her anyway.
'Daddy has to go now.
Yeah.
Just put her on.
No, Ben.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Don't!
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Say what, Walt Spoon!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
I'll be switched!...
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
There's something else.
The Blue Men?
Sshhh...
To see Dad?
It'll spoil our supper.
Dead.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Come on, children!
I don't know nothin'!
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
Under the stone in the floor.
You could save him, little bird.
Mm-hm.
That's no secret. I'm five.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
No.
O' course.
Yes; from the first night.
Our honeymoon.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
You believe in anything?
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Great.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Krueger.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Of course. What's that?
Jungle man fix Jane.
What are you serving?
You should be more careful, Anna.
I see.
What is it, Anna?
That's right.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
No, that's bad management.
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
That's all right.
Good evening, Monsieur.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
It's a real Paris reunion.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Razinin.
Comrade.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Au revoir.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Business.
I think so too.
I must get into that country of yours!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're going to force us... huh?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Yes. Could you give me some information?
At what intervals does he whistle?
I will do my best.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Is that customary?
I will start with you.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
As a representative of Moscow...
Will you smile?
I don't think so.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Did you make any change in this room?
Ninotchka, I love you.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
No. Nobody will find us.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
So happy and so tired.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Good morning, Swana.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
Unfortunately.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
What do you want?
Why?
That depends on the tip.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
May I ask what has happened?
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu. 
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
I like that.  That's a solution.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Yeah?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
Why not?
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
What's Liddy got?
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
Fucking hell.
We were working on China.
Silence!
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
All right.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
You never told him?
... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
Sir ... six bodies.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
I beg your pardon --
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Where you from?
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
The hell with 'em.
POWs.  And their families.
Of them.
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
Are you serious?
I'll never run again.  I promise.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
I've missed you.
Are you okay?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
What?
Some say you are, Rocky.
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
How you been, Ellis?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
How come're you doin that?
Nineteen zero and nine.
I'm... discouraged.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
Yessir.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Okay.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
No.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
I need to know that.
What're you doin', baby?
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Well -- how come?
Yes I do.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Yes ma'am?
I shall return.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
I seen you was from Dallas.
I was just passin' the time.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Everything.
All right. Heads then.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
They'll give you a wallop.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
You on all night?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
How well do you know Chigurh.
I don't mean braze.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
What product.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Junior year!
Anyway, so what?
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
"Banners?"
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I better go check on them.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
The LeSabre!
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...
Do what?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
You never gave us a chance...
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Thanks...
They're new to us...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
I came for love...
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
I'd slap his face.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
That's horrible!
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
You're hurting him!!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
I was talking about what you could wear!
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
...okay.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Of what?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
What 'look'?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
What?
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
Betty was a lovely child.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
...who doesn't?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Hang on there -
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Gopher, Everett?
Okay, Everett.
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Latch right on to that tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Well that hardly sounds like you...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
Yes, Sir.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
Great ass.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Naw. That's over with.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
I called you Sarge.
I didn't call you anything before that.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir.
No, sir!
Where are you from, boy?
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
One more minute.
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
He didn't give you much choice.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
That's it?
It sure was.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Twenty-two years ago.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Yeah. All week long.
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
God.
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
Please...
I can't.
Th --
I know.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Pure idiot.
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Everything okay?
Oh, that phone call...
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Not at all.
It's okay, Raoul.
It's just the woman and the kid?
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
I'm here.  I'm here.
Huh uh.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Damn straight.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
No man. PE -- "political education."
Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
No man. Gonna walk.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Brimmer.
If you got something to say, say it.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
Good.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
The hell I do.
Apology accepted.
What officers?
Sir.
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
Yes.
You're in no condition to ride.
Oh?
God help us all when you're forty.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
You don't hate him.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Thirteen years...
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
Who's in command?
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Four, five miles.
Put them away.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
I know.
Yeah, sure.
I'm sure you're not.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Then come on.
I'm not climbing that.
Is there quicksand?
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
Because it's right.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Yes.
Nope. He's your cat now.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
I'm sure.
That boat is my livelihood!
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
All right then.
Very good.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Yes, father.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
You're in league with Barbossa!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
Exactly.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
This must be some important boat.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Only a little.
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
On what?
Jack!
It's the right way.
Yes.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
No.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Then you still love me?
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Considering what?
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Yeah, I do!
I like Trix!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Who isn't?
Okay.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
It already is.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
Got it.
What happens?
Three days ago it was.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Blame the victim.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
What did you want my hair for?
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
The same thing I suppose.
I remember I was trying to help...
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Dexter.
Goodbye, Stew
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Gallagher?
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Yeah, hello. How are you?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Yeah.
With me you can always do business.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
A what?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Sure.
Araby, my eye!
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Dawson, sir.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Thank you, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
I hope you'll be very happy.
It's the smoke.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Yes - and I'd love it.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
I suppose you know why I came?
She did?
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
Hello, Joe.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Are the cars ready?
Why
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
All right, Grandma
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Yes, sir.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Thanks.
Yeah?
What?
Hello Bill.
No she's not.
It's alright.
No ...
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It is?
I don't believe it.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
You're not allowed to lie.
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What do you mean!?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Get lost!
We're supposed to be in school.
Owns the hardware store.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Play along?
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
What?
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
It's in your closet.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Sure.
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
You don't know?
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
... Like Prince Charming.
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
Where are you going ...
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Oh--well ...
Why?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Yeah.
I'll never be able to do that.
Well here I am.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
What's the listing?
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I have work, I can't leave.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
Hi. This is Jack.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
I'm in my bedroom.
No.
...yeah.....
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You sound very cute, very nice.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Not very late.
Yeah.
I need help.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Sure.
It's Barry.
You like her?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Ok.
Ok. Have a good trip.
So what do I do then?
Ok.
It's Barry.
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Can I come home with you when we get there?
You can't do that.
Just have you for one second, please.
No.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
That's fine.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
That was weird. I meant good.
It's alright.
Like a psychiatrist?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Ok.
Please don't do this.
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Is this where you live?
Yes I am.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What time are you gonna be there?
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Put him through.
It's fine.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
At your service, Count.
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
Don't be so sure.
Enough to discern its tenor.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
-- water! --
-- that was lust --
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
Of course.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
But I am history.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
"Well worth the dig!"
Don't start --
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
There's something else I want from you.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Most assuredly.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
I am not a wealthy woman.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Last week would this be?
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Yeah
Bel Air is restricted.
There's nothing to explain
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I wanted it
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Please be quiet.
I am not doing Hearst.
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Nope.
But with compassion and insight--
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
So they're Jews. . .
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
It was fun, wasn't it?
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
And where you goin'?
Nothing...
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
You know, like bang her or anything?
Give me a chance. Let me look.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
What?
Whadda ya mean?
Does that mean...
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Come here.
Go 'head. Do it.
Now take your panties off.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Yeah, what?
What did I say?
What did I do?
All I did...
Jake...
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
OK. Talk.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Are you drunk?
He should.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Who left -- where?
Give him evidence.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
You figured that out, huh?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I told you that --
Like what?
Congratulations, Jeff.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
Gunnison?
I don't know what you mean.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
She expects me to marry her.
I'm not ready for marriage.
That's the hard part.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
I was.
Depends one which one.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Not yet, Jeff.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Goodnight, you idiot.
Not too active.
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
Three.
You mean "goodnight."
So do I.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Too close.
Nobody chickened.
They always live.
I'm cute, too.
What?
I like you, you know?
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
Down in back.
You make any sandwiches?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Plato.
Who has?
Who's that!
Yeah?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
What?
We'll take it!
Hey!  How 'bout that!
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
I'm here.
I'm fine.
You sure?
Goodbye, dear.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
What's that got to do with it?
Why should you be the only one.
Leave me alone.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
But you don't think that's a solution.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
See?
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
A what?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I bet you hear everything I say!
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
What?
It's all right.
What?
My mother?
Why?
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Gabriel -- !
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Don't hurt him...
YES!!!
NO!
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Negative five?
One more. Smile. One more.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
We could live it up and --
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
What the fuck is going on.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
He working for them on this one?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Nick...
No.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
No --
The hell I can't.
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
So you could get with my sister.
So you could get down her chimney.
Hey.
I said, who the hell made the map?
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
No.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Take 'em.
And where they hide the real money.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
And some pecan pie.
I'm just saying.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
You're hitting for MY cards!
What? No...
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
You're coming back to work for us, right?
I'll call somebody.
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Yeah.
What? Snap out of it!
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Your name's Freddy something.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What're you talkin' about?
Joe.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
A few cops.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
What do you think?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Where? Are they out in the car?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
For all I know, you're the rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I think he's just passed out.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
He asked.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
We don't think this place is safe.
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
Just about.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I hope so, too.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
I suppose that's my fault.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Why?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
So did I. They were in it.
A man I used to know.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
I don't care what she asked you.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Yeah.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
We don't want to go there.
Up the trail.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
No. We're not stayin' --
Sure.
Oh, sure.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Ray, have you been here all this time?
He's so brave.
Yeah.
Sure. We can practice talking.
No. Try a little higher.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Oh.
What, you think I did this to myself?
So, whatever happened to her?
Made you say it!
Oh.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Are these all the subjects?
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
Right. What about condoms?
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Even in the bathroom?
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Yes.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
Mother? 
MURDERED?!!
Why?
Oh Mom...
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
I certainly was not!
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
You got your wish.
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
Bon Appetit!
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
You can?
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
What circumstances?
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She's a pretty good sort.
I guess most people are.
Nothing.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
Weren't you afraid?
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
No!
I don't know.
You will die.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
But it's a small room, Jason.
I have to go -
What's wrong, Mary?
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
She's not been here for a long time.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Please.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Because I have something very important to do.
Yes?
Curious.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Thank you.
Impotent.
So you don't believe in therapy?
You had sex with you therapist?
Not really.
Everything about sex.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
Who was the last person you had sex with?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
Interesting analogy.
But if you were?
But I don't understand --
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Not entirely.
Possibly.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Are you having an affair?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I want out of this marriage.
Yes.
He does.
Yeah, so?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
What visitor?
Is he still at your house?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
That you are under no obligation to me?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Why?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Why?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I have a pretty good idea.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Will you stop? Jesus.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.
Why?
You couldn't do it, period.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
It does not.
Hold on.
No.
There's a phone here.
The extrovert.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
She didn't give you my address?
Nope.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
About what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Nothing.
And you ask questions, right?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
What did he say?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Right.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
In here!!
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Nothing wrong with trying.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
How about straightening up the living room?
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
Well, let's go talk to your doctor.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
So who changes?
Who was she?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
I don't get it.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
BREAKING OUT
Fools!
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
Everything's free there.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
That doesn't make sense.
Who?
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
F for...
What does he know about it?
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Bye.
How's the trip?
And?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
My condolences.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Highliner.
I'm good.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
No, I'm an actor.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
What?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Now.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
We were supposed to play golf.
She's been leaving messages here too.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Oh yeah. Sure.
What do you think's going on?
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
Slaughterhouse.
What's happening?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
What?
Yeah.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Please, Miles, please.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Yeah.
Back at you.
Good for you.
Twelve months in oak.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
How long have you been into wine?
What was the bottle that did it?
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Oh. You mean... today?
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Ken.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Where?
Right.
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
They already know we're here.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Have they said anything about our area?
Don't do it.
They tell you everything in this book.
They win.
What's that?
The footprints.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
What did you say?
It was my fault.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
It's one thing to know it...
I already did that.
And you're not Baxter, either?
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
You got no idea what they were after?
I had to get up anyway.
Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
It's a town...
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
Believe it.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
You're kidding.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
I don't have any family any more.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Because they enjoy it.
You've got a legitimate job.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
Good-bye, Paden.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
Oh, yeah? How good?
He left me.
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
Of course.
Good-bye.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- It's called a projector.
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
I can't wait to meet her.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Even the fall from the plane.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Simone does not control my destiny.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
She said you were very beautiful.
Really?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Impossible.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
It was a great show, Dad...
Because obviously she existed, right?
Well, I --
Simone?
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Who are you really?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
For her?
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
I know what you mean.
I've seen them all before.
I don't know anything about computers.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
You know, I... don't know.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
It's a yacht.
Abduction?
She looks a lot like you.
Is that why she left you?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
-- What you don't understand --
You know what I'm talking about.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Something I want?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
Don't fail me.
You believe me, right?
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
You do?
A lady. She died.
Got it.
Who!
S-ssssstop it!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
What are you talking about?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Superstition.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
See?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Not someone -- Mac.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Book of Jeremiah.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
I thought you said two hundred.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
He's right. You were behind.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Nah. Just you.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Why bother?
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Whatcha' doin'?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Don't worry, Chief.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Shut up.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
That's disrespectful.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Okay.
Through a wound on his stomach?
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Driving, talking to me...
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
By stealing my car?
What kind of a guy is he?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
No what?
No.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
Redneck heaven.
Save it. We got a long haul.
What's your twenty?
Not for long, you ain't.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
What's that, pardner?
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Uh, yeah.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
But there were more of you?
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
No, what did you say on the machine?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
My debrief --
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
I'm here.
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Yeah, I can front this.
Shoot.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Listen --
You fucking bastard...
How quickly?
He's dead.
What?
Shut up.
And professionally?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Why?
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
What kind of look?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
I did too.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Do you?
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
I'm not Snow.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Hard to find doors in this place.
Queens... You know Queens?
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
So it was "love".
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
You could do better.
I can't open it.
Stop being nuts!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
They called here after you left...
What do you want to do?
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
So.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Nothing.
Absolutely.
My ass if falling.
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
You don't want to hear about it.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
It should've been me...
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
You should'a brought the girl.
Why should she come in?
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
What, want a glass?
Oh, sure.
Hm.  What a lump.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Lemme down, bugface!
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Well...
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
I'm sure you kept warm.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Why?
So you've found Thorkel?
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
You sure about all this?
I know him.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
That's the understatement of the year.
Let's talk in the hall.
I left a paper in my desk.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
No
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
No, no!  Not there!
We did not.
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
You are talking crazy!
It's on me.
What is your number?
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What exactly is he charged with?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Lay off! The blonde is mine!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Me? What if she don't want me?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
So what? There's other women!
You did?
That's what I wanna hear.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
A little weak today.
Are we boring you?
Says me.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
You did!
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
Give me the radio.
Fine -- fine!
Here. Take them.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
All hands, brace for impact!
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Please, please.
Please, I insist.
It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
I always do.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
All right, all right. You've made your point.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Aye, sir.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Locate.
A photon tube...!
Short range scan.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
Count on our help, sir.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Close... There --
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Who is this?! How dare you --
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... Spock...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Understood, my lord.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Wait!... Wait...
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
I can spare me...
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
They're still running with shields down.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Rake her.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
He'll die -- !
Yes, SIR.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Or the one.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Affirmative, Admiral.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Be careful, Jim...
Best we could do in two hours.
Best speed, Scotty...
Spock...!
Yes, sir.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
By the book...
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
The top of what?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
I was not.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
What do you mean now?
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
What's what?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Kirk. They're gone.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
In progress, Admiral.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
... Simple logic.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Right.  Will you help us?
What is our condition?
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
How long, Scotty?
I'll have to re-energize.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Do you have the right to murder?
Of course.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Just use the keyboard...
That's the ticket, laddie.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
You're what?
Do machines ever play?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
No one's ever asked me that before.
The artificial lifeform was right?
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
Understood.
You're not finished here?
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
A planet in Federation space...
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
Thank-you for reminding me.
Are they...?
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Why not?
Remind me to lodge a protest...
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Picard to Crusher...
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
What are they interested in...?
Good question.
What you're doing to my neck...
Whatever makes you comfortable...
... I'm not sleeping well...
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
I never kissed you with a beard before.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
I... do not want this...
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
More lies.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Can you configure it?
Where's the Sphere?
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
But how?
Understood. Keep me informed.
How serious is the damage?
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
You don't sound French.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Something wrong with that?
The invasion plans.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Yes, he is.
You're lying.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
Destroy the deflector dish.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
Fascinating...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
We're not finished.
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
That cunning little Vulcan...
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
They'll make it look like an accident...
Very much.
I know what you mean...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Thank you, Captain.
I like it here...
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Captain.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
You have personally -
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
I am uncertain.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
You can't prove any of this...
A computer canna lie, sir.
This one can.
I believe I am.
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
I do not understand.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Can you describe it, Deanna?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Good work. The download?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
You do not look like me.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
Do you have a moment, sir?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
How could I not?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?

That will never happen.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
You know I need to verify this.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
No race should be a slave to another.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
Yes.
With a full head of hair.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
I am.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
Now go. I have some personal business.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
I'll take that.
And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
Dashboard.
Coupons.
Pancakes.
Closed?
Are you from up there? Space?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
I want to try it.
I need you.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Is that a baby?
Yes.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
What?
Yes?
What is hell?
Are you my friend?
I am your friend.
You liked my singing?
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
I gave you a baby last night.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
What will you say about us?
You could have killed us both!!
What? No, of course not.
Doesn't make sense.
We're ready.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
No.
Was there visual contact?
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
We can't let you do that.
No problem.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
What're you going to do?
No, Lenny.
You talked to Iris?  When?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
No.  Mace is in this.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
You bet.  Did you like it?
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Sorry.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Who was just here?
Sleaze to peddle.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
Jesus, Mace!
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Are you going to make me beg?
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
You really want that on your head?
Um... he was older.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Hi there.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
What's wrong with me?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
What did he look like?
At the field office.
This better be important.
Who?
Go ahead.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
"Was?"
Collected shoes too?
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
None taken.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Don't be too harsh.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
I've been thinking about this.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
That's true.
What's up?
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
He's moved on to TV.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Zero killed them all?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
You knew it was me all along?
It was the mall.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
The boy's okay. I saw him...
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Koessler?
Take your shirt off.
Shit.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
No. Stop, come on.
What's that like?
How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...and even then...
My pleasure.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Why not?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
No, no. Hold on.
Fine... I guess. You?
What kind of things?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
It's a gig.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Oh.  Where is this place?
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
Well, let's hit that party.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
I got to at least try once.
She wasn't your type anyway.
They turned you down?
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
You always know the right thing to say.
I can't believe you.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Tonight, baby.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Did she, or did she not smile?
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
...gotta...
Baby, you did fine.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
What?
Yeah, a good friend.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Minnie Pearl.
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
...Is he brown?
...How novel.
See, baby?
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
Now go over there and get those digits.
...Yeah.
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
An eye for an eye!
America has been good to me...
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
What percentages for my family?
Are you worried about security for your million?
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
But you needed a drink first.
Barzini.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
Accept what's happened, Michael.
You wanted me to be your son.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
How do you know I come from America?
Get rid of them...
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Right.
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Just you.
Michael.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
OK. 
Let HER ask.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Probably a year...
I do renounce them.
Thanks.
Is he alive?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
You just woke up!
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Okay.
It's just an undercoat. 
Say again?
That's funny.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
I met him in New York.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
So tell me.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
I just don't believe that!
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I'm sure we've met.
My fiance.
Sure.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello Marge!
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
To the manner born.
He's having an early night.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Shut up! Shut up!
I don't believe a single word you've said.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Right.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Beating you away.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
We'll be there.
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
He says so many fiances.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
What do you mean lied about who you are?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Even her.
No!
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
You have, yes.
Is there a firing range around?
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
You want to canvass?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
The moon?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
The DMZ?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
You know what you remind me of?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Just what?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Awh, come off it, Pal.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
The kind with a brush.
No.
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
Easy.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Do they drug you?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Where is home?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
My work may take me out of New York.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I can't sleep nights.
Military record?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Anything you say, officer.
Real down.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Tell me what you really do.
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Whatever happens.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
That's my girl!  Did you...?
It's possible.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Through the door.  It comes apart.
Oh.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Well, son, you're home!
"It's a Wonderful Life."
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
When did I leave?
Ah.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
... Ernie.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
Pete...
Thanks.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
What's his rent?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
"Ashes To Ashes?"
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Exactly.
When was that?
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
No.
Yeah... me too.
Oh.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
No, not really.
Yes.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Yes.
I think so.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Yes.
I know.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Lois!
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
What name?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
I need her exact name, you see.
Shall I call the doctor?
I'm simply quoting the law.
I know, Mother.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I don't know.
They won't be.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Cathy. At the school.
Do I sound foolish to you?
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Yes.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
I couldn't ask you to.
Not by the thousands.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Sixty...  Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
All right.  She smiles back.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
We met in court.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Yes?
We... we went to school together. College.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
It is for me.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
Like what?
And Fridays? What do you do then?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Take wing!
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Have we still got power?
Maybe.
These weren't a few birds.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
With smoke.
We need them.
Can't you please finish your drink?
But can't you give me any idea?
I want you to help my little girl.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
Excuse me.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Not yet.
Why, yes.
A doctor?
Afraid of what?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Burke them?
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
She would if she could.
I'll get him.
Where are they?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
What? Call the police?
Where the fuck did you come from?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
I was talking about you.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Honey. I just can't.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I don't believe you.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
I can judge only by what I see.
Well, we could--
You still haven't answered my question.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Come on in.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Is that what you're thinking about?
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Where is the meeting going to be?
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
The Prince of Darkness.
The meanest!
That's right.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
What happens in tow and a half hours?
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Lots more where he came from.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
We are...
I'm tired now.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
You've heard this story before?
Can we get a T.V.?
Not funny, Sam!
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
I'm Michael.
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Even poor people have T.V.s
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
I know.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Maybe.
Anybody sick?
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
Have you come across Fuchs?
Now who'd go and do...
Let go of me...
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Well, go on.
Probably the next meal.
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Nothing we can do about that.
Don't let up, Childs!
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
And that was enough?
Why?
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
When do you think it got to him?
Hear what?
What?!
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Morlocks --
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Excuse me?
Yes.
It was meant to.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
This has to end.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
I will...
No, we created the Morlocks.
No...
I just love mechanical things.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
I mean... well... affection.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
What?
She's gotten into your equations.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
Then why are you here?
I care more about my life.  And yours.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
He's gone to a better place.
Good night.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
We all have that dream.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Is it?
It's undamaged?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
May I get you some --
Exactly correct, sir.
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
He said he traveled for two months.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
No, you're safe --
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
In where?
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
Yeah.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
Please...
Yes.
Why?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
I don't know.
I guess I'd ask you why.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
I'll die either way.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Maybe.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
So you never knew your mother?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
Why?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Yes, sir.  I know.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
What did ya do?
I'm a robber.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Tell me.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
How come he let you go?
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
You're not touchin' that car.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man.
I won't wait up.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Now what what?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Shoot the radio!
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
You do?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We've gone insane.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Oh.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah... sure did.
I'll try to be more careful.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
He implied it.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Well think about it.
Uh-huh.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
I'm usually too tired to be.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Yep.
Nepal? Have you been?
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Warren!
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't buy it.
No.
No.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
Really?  Very, very?
No, not at all.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Do what?
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
You mean him.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Bullshit!
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Why you son of a --
I never said that.
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
'That right? Good for you.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Healy.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Who's that?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
He's dead.
You look great.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Yeah, sure.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Mary, come on...
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
I wasn't trying --
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
What --
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
Tomorrow...
Zorin will eat him alive!
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
I don't care. Cancel it.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Goodbye.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
Check him out, Ray.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
He said he doesn't know.
Because he was talking to me.
He saw an owl.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Cuz you're a cop.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
We're going for The Stronghold.
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Great.
Good.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Do you want a coffee?
No. No, no. Thank you.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
What the fuck you talkin' about?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
Where were you?
Apology acknowledged.
I'm special.
Uh hum.
How about what?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You ever think about killing another human being?
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
This is it, then.
I want it back.
What?
Yesterday.
Hardly ever.
Take something off.
And that's one!
I live here, remember?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
Were upside down!
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Since when did you care about paperwork?
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
No shit. The Iceman....
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
I can't eject.
Let's go. Eject.
I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
You saved our lives. You did it!
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Figured out what?
I think I can work it out on my own.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
Just below ten thousand.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Yes sir!
Is that how you remember it?
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
Or you can quit.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
He was by the book, all the way.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
You better get down here.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
That's right.
Not since you lost him.
There!  The woman!
O.K., everybody pull out!
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Lori, move.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
I guess he didn't.
Not any more.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Why would I lie to you?
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Just wondering.
I saw them.
It's just up ahead.
What?
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Howdy, Rhonda.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Has a lot of rain.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
We got a plan!
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
You are so full of shit...
You bet.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
God, what a stink!
Yeah.  One, two, three...
It does.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
Can't I take a simple piss without --
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
-- The Nazi he knifed?
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
-- You found his mugshot?
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I followed her from the courthouse.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I haven't paid you.
Right.
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
You tell me, man.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
No? Then what did he say?
Shouldn't one of us...?
-- What trial?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
Yeah, we do some of that.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
That's right.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
NO! GOD, NO...
What was?
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
Okay, Gordon!!!
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
ALBERT?
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Any friends?
That's good.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Faulty wiring.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
I don't know what to do.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Laura, I am your friend.
Cause I like it.
Maybe.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
Oh, yes... yes...
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
I'm sorry, Mom.
A special friend?
We're late to get to your mother.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Oh, Leland.
Look at this finger here.
That's right.
You're right. There's no one here.
Yes.
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Four cases in three years...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
It looks that way.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
I'm going to uphold that.
Yes.
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Well, we...
There's nothing they can do to me.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Why is that?
I am seventy-four years old.
'Code Blue'...
I understand.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
How old is he?
Yes.
I used to be a nurse.
Yes.
Thank you for seeing me.
Ready, your Honor.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
That's what I'm going to try to do.
...and is that serious?
I've got to work.
You're talking like a drunk.
Well, then what are you doing here?
No.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...You saw her?
Where is he?
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
...now who is that...?
What do you want?
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
The broad has disappeared...
I just saw her.
Yes.
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We, we were rather busy...
Should I?
Yes.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
Sure...get in!
It was...  ...one of them!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
I don't follow.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase, you'd better come home.
No.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Everything is not fine!
Your bed?
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
Here.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Coffee'd be nice.
Me too.
Your father?
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Fifteen.
No, I can't.
What do you mean?
What?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Shut up, Phil.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
Yes sir.
All stop on the engine.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
No.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Yes.  I do.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
That's enough.
We'll think of something.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Trust me donut.  I know.
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
But, they don't speak English.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
No.  I didn't.
Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
No.
Whattaya mean family?
When did you talk to Lula?
That's right... Take one of these.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
What's the name of it?
Set one up.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Whattaya do there?
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
But I am also with the government.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
What happened on the charges?
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
But I'm wild at heart.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
Yeah, maybe...
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
You got me, peanut.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
No radio or TV...
Sailor?
You sick?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
He's the kind liked it.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Just a place.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
Got any plans?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Yes.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
Your wife.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
She's still a transvestite.
Isn't she?
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Shut up and drink.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Only in your bones?
Which is?
Ye-es?
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
So what's the problem?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Find the jacket.
...we find the jacket.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
Shoot.
You're in Kinship?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
This is worth it.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
No.
Your aunt?
Colon cancer.
What kind of dancer?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
That's right. That one.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
What?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Jealous? Of me?
In a minute. Get us a table.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
When nobody's looking.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Neither do I.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
I love you, Grady.
Really, Sara, I...
Inside.
Grady.
And what do you think you might have said?
I said it didn't sound like you.
I'm through improvising.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I guess you have to go on faith.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
What's that?
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Yes?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
I... I...
I'm in love with your wife.
And?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
I might have his number on campus.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
Huh?
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
The birthday party.
Ah, come on.
It's not what you think.
You don't have to tell me this.
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
Sure.
Is that right?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
I can't.
Cop.
I have no idea.
Got something to hide?
Fairy tales?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
What's with the boxes?
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yeah.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Are you sure?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
It's all the same.
You think reflection is good.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
What is your idea of being normal?
What did you want to happen?
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
I see my sister.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
You felt pleasure.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
I'm just quiet.
They could eat you.
Why do you want to know?
What?
Yeah.
How many girls did you molest?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
No. Never again.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
I'm not scared.
What's it look like?
Do you want to talk about it?
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
How deep's the drop-off here?
Hey, you okay?
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
No.
What about O-2?
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Hi, lady.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
God, I hate that bitch.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Wilhite, anything?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
How should I be ... arrogant?
No.
But then when will we see each other?
It takes even less.
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
Why?
Better dead.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
No.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
What do you mean by sensible?
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
I appeal to you more?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Unfortunately, no.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
They didn't seem too good.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Lady Patrizia!
Is that possible?
Is that far from here?
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
That's not what he meant.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Who?
No.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
Love.
Everyone.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Anything?
Would you like to be?
Would you like some?
Why not?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
What else did she tell you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Do you?
No.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
What the child?
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
She can.
She watches... she listens.
Yes?
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Doctor Livingston.
I'm afraid.
I ate.
Go away, I don't want you here.
Him.
Agnes who did you see?
Agnes, who did this to you?
Yes.
Yes.
Marty, what are you doing here?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
You have proof?
What does this have to do with..?
Who told you this?
What man had access to her?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Shortly after she came to us.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
The Catholic Church...
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
I am...
Nothing.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
And Agnes' father?
She molested her!
I haven't decided yet.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Mary Magdelen?
Of course.
You're saying God did it?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
I'm concerned about her health.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
And the baby.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Then she's a liar.
Eh?
The cards... you're bank.
Y'what?
Yeah.
Sorry? 
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
A butcher?
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
Come here.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Yes.
Aye, I knew you were.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Eh?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
For Ringo.
He's got you worried, then?
So's mine.
No.
We were going to do it.
Come on speedy!
I would though.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Aren't we ...
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
Who?
Clever.  George.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Is that you, Roby?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Don't you remember?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Well, get started.
Right.  Talk to you.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It grows on you.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Dead.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
The water will still recycle.
Here, let me try.
Well we better do something.
Right.
And be right back.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
He's running a fever.
Yes.
We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I've completely lost their signal.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
How many?
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
It's not going to work.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
Can you see anything?
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Yeah?
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Any microorganisms?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
You win.
What's that supposed to mean?
I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
No... don't...
Is it dead?
Too many.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Deal.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
I dunno.
Forget it, man.
What's wrong?
Done it already.  Nothing matches.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Compensate!
Looks like it.
What?  Why?
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Don't wait for me!
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Just like it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Frankly - yes.
Paved with what, then?
You have no right to say such things!
... and Karen.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
You sat and talked until it was light...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
I never intended you to be.
What do you mean by that?
What have you got to do with it?
That's not true!
Yes, Addison.
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
And too many of them are produced.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Then you two must have a long talk-
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Bill-
That's nice.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
As of this moment you're six years old...
Sing it?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
I love you too. Good night, darling-
See you...
Cut it out.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
That never stopped you before.
So she seems.
- guilty.
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
So full of meaning, fire and music!
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
I mix what I like.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
Margo, let's make peace.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
Yes, dear.
With the paper to prove it.
Why.
Is it the money?
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
Also Addison deWitt.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
You think?
No thanks, Birdie.
But she just got here...
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
Why not?
Probably not.
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
Subway.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
Hollywood.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Oh, but there is-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
He can help you.
I'll never get over it.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Of course.
Harrington.
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Why should he - and why should you?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
Well... all right.
With tears.
Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
That's on time for Margo.
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
What is?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
That was way back...
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
... Among so many quiet qualities.
To you, too?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
I didn't hear you.
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Hmm.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
Were you eyebrow reading?
My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."  And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper."  Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.
We appreciate your position--really.
'68.
You voted for him.
--shit, who do we know?--
--has he got an ax?--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
--we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
11:30.
--Howard Hunt?
--Teddy Kennedy?
I know where Dwight works.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
...No... never in so many words...
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
I will not talk about the other two.
My non-denial denial.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I have nothing more to say.
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Go on.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Mitchell knew then.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
I think so.
It may never come out.
But it's possible.
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
I'm not good in math.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Neither did I!
Why is this?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
I'm glad you think so.
What?  No I'm not.
How did you know I was here?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
You called me Oz.
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Yeah, that's right.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
I'll save you a seat.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
You fuckin' rule!
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
C-Span?
After getting laid?
God dammit, Stifler!
Kevin, this is serious!
Not for you.
Just a second!
I love you.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Exactly.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
What?
It's making me hungry.
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Right.
Shit!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
And you call me a moron...
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
Yeah?
Why the fuck would I do that?
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
When you're older . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I'm not sure but look. . .
I shant!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
I'm sorry.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
I'm glad you	did too.
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
Bartok... a question.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Ah! Let us begin!
Are you feeling all right?
Watch me.
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
And tell me that she's happy.
I had nothing to do with it!
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
What?
All the good meetings are taken.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Well, then, w-who was?
Hey, that was last year.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Me? Oh, downtown!
Well, where is it? I-
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Oh, right.
Huh?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Okay.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
No, I'm gonna quit!
Okay?
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
You don't want me to live with you?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Uh-uh-why?
U-huh.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Were you always funny?
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
David? You call your teacher David?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'hm.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
I'm following you and David, if you-
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Is he in the bathroom?
Very big spider.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Yeah?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
What... huh?
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Yeah.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Right before his un-American thing.
Stop calling me Max.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Where?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
And... uh-
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
We're going to take them to the airport.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Oh, gosh.
There's a whole wing in this house.
A long time.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'd say it was down.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
And you're not the wife.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
But she's alright.
Fuck you.
Leave us alone right now.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Yeah, thanks pal.
You only made half your quote this year.
Happy anniversary.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I wanted you back.
I have no idea who you are.
Lovely.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes.
Do I put you off?
Ah.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
I meant Sally.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
A lot of cakes.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
What?
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Not at all.
Yes.
The charades.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Not enough.
How?
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
We're just feeling our way back.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Why not?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
I'll be right out.
I don't mind...
Yes.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
You weren't exactly horrified.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
Quiet -- sshhh!!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
Yes...he's wonderful...
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
...Not enough food?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
Why are we so successful?
Yeah, I know.
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Oh, I never catch colds.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Fine.  Wait.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
How is your cold?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
His apartment?
What's her first name?
Miss. 
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
I'm not very good at it.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
I'm sure that's the explanation.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Here.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 
Oh.
Fine.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
I'm fine.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Sir?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
What?
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Slow down, kid.
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
Something like that.
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
Not particularly.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
No.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I missed you, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
We talked about a lot of things.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
You know I do.
I love you -- remember?
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Yeah.
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
Let's go.
Listen.
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Who knows? Right.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
Captain?
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
What about an American named Kurtz?
That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Don't you agree?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
How's the pain?
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
That's me.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Anyone got a card?
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
I'll tell you everything later.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
You know Meyerling?
You don't feel cold?
It was blown up with the plane.
I already have.
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
No, I better stay at my post.
Sure.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
You met the gift.
I'm a waitress.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Oh, please...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Now I want you to do something for me.
Two days.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
What's that got to do with it?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Are you still coming?
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
It was a mistake.
I can trust my brain.
Cute.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
How to die, mostly.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Okay, then.
Thank you for walking him.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Absolutely not.
What is this?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
How long have you been freelance?
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
What?  What's okay?
What does that fucking mean?
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
What?
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Turn off the engine.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Why?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
How?
Why?
It's not the same, is it?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
No, they didn't.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
I don't.
No.
What happens if you do?
Okay.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Check.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
What?  What if he brings it with him?
Except --
I was.
You didn't take it.
I think I got one today.
I didn't notice them.
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Because, I'll take it.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
It can be.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
I waited another four minutes.
Electra --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Honesty.
Taken.
That's exactly what I told myself.
Some.
Anything.
I have all day.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Never heard of K-MART?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I thought that was part of the charm!
Thought of everything haven't you.
'cause you stink of booze.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
When your ready Son!
What?
What are you on about?
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
They ain't the only ones.
He got that one right.
Lucky break!
Yeah, somewhere?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Yes.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
What?
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
What? You are crazy!
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No way Doug, I can't.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
There's nothing there for me.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
What for?
Insurance!
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
Am I invited?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
I had it coming from someone.
Guests.
Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
What for?
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
And what of these foreigners?
With you.
I. Don't. Dance.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Late night.  You?
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
You do --
Later.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Me.
'They won't.'
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Why?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
The world of the dead?
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Your father doesn't like me.
I'm really glad you think so.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
That sounds like horseshit.
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
I have to get you home by one.
It's only 7:30.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
We're doing something -- ?
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
What do you actually know with religion?
That. And less strange.
Away from here.
Hoped for it.
No.
Better. I was really angry.
Yes.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Ever again.
You decide.
Praying.
I need to be with her.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Yes.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
I'd do that --
Where did you get -- ?
You came here to give me my report card?
Yeah.
Are you?
Third time they've been out there this week.
Uh, thanks...
You do?
Okay, then!
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Run out of gas?
What's this all about?
Oh, right, right... 
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
Sure, he agreed quickly.
Professor, be serious, would you?
You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
A car.
What? 
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
What did you do to your hair?
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
What's going on?
Okay.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
Okay.
Jack.
What for?
What?
He'll say that?
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
I don't care.
Don't ask me.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Why?
How's he doing?
Excuse me.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Well, he didn't have it last night.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Planet 10?
Vanished. Thin air.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
What is it, Tommy?
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
To get my guns.
You.  Like the papers all say.
It's kinda hard this way.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Any time.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
John Whorfin will kill us!
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Why me?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Please, Barton.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
So be it.
Well... actually, no Bill...
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
...Huh? No, I'm 
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
Go ahead, son.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
What a dump...
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
What do you think happened?
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week  that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
And then... well...
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Must be.
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights  both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering  I thought we were together on that.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
It's been three months.
Sometimes I really hate you.
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
I thought you hardly know her.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Put your hands up!
I know who you are.
If that's the way you want to play it.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
No.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Do you?
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What do you want from me, Catherine?
What's it about?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
She's seen everything before.
Did you like her to watch?
Everybody that I care about dies.
Make love to me.
I never have before.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
When?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Funny.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Come over here and tell me no.
What happens to them?
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
Did you ever tie him up?
Yes I am.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Sometimes.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
That's him.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
What are you doing here, Pop?
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
What is it you got between you?
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You don't like punk rockers?
Why the hell not?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
I'm a painter, too.
The whole thing  painting.
It's in New Jersey.
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
What's wrong?
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
I know.
Sure.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
I'm here.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Not what?
Not black.
Who am I?
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Drugs??!
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Sure. I'd be glad to.
Some of them.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Yeah.
Alright, thanks.
I'm -- sorry, I --
We do.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I'm tempted.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
And the truth frightened her?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
No.  No glass on the inside.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
My lips are sealed.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
And a very, very good one.
Actually, it's a lot like that.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Coming on line now, sir.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
What are you talking about?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Definitely.
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
She knows who we are.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
Dear daisy, don't despair.
You lie!
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I find that unlikely.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Apology hastily retracted.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
Is he all right?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
What?
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Enigma.
Four seconds from...
What's wrong?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
My life's an open book. You read?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
... Very good, sir.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
What are you talking about?
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
Great.  Give me a grant.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
... Looks like a convention.
... Where are you calling from?
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
WHAT??
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you talking about?
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Allie, he's not.
He's not crazy.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
Thanks, Annie.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Yes, isn't he.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Er ... pray tell me why?
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
And a car.
Welsh.
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Of course he is.
Are you?
This sucks.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Forget it, bunghole!
Heh heh. Thank God.
Uh...
Heh hmm heh heh.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Turd-burglar...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Really? I poop too much.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
How's your arm?
I am sitting.
... Hmmm?
Won't?  Or can't?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
I know.  I'm sorry.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
All right.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
You don't kill anyone.
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
<u>Out</u>.
Our cemetery?
About what?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
I want to be dead too.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Where'd they go?
I want to get in.
No, dummy.  Two.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
You've got to help them.
Otho'll know what to do.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
I think she's in with them.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Attic space.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
I see.
Yes, Robert. I will.
It's fine today, Robert.
... Oh? You've heard?
... But he's...?
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
There's no need for a hospital.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Yes. Thank you.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Of course.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Good night, Eve.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes. It's a very good show.
So you know Krylov!
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Oh.
No.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
I see.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Yes, I'm very hungry.
You're welcome.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Thank you.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
How were you paid?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
1952...?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Yes, I understand.
... Oh, really...
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Yes, ma'am.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
Good night.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
That could be possible...
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
I'm afraid so.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Yeah, okay.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
'kay.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Yes.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
You came up here looking for the portal?
Holy shit, yes!
Let me try!
I am a trained performer.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
My tits?
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
Tickets to Malkovich?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Hush, sweetheart.
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
I like that.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Good morning, Lotte!
Says who?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Do we get to wear a crown?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
No, I didn't know that.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
One hour.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
Who's calling?
How'd you get this number?
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
What the fuck is going on?
Lotte called me.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm getting better all the time.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Folks come. Folks go.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying nothing counts?
Aw, Baby.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
Don't pay to complain.
Well, good luck with the job.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
Be here. In case.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Ella.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
You planning to do anything about it?
Never found out.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
You got to get up from here, girl.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Shit.
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
Where's your car, Dude?
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Please!  Please!
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Excuse me?
You're not interested in sex?
Yeah, but what about--
Maude?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
No, but--
What the fuck are you--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Hey man--
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Huh?
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Thanks Walter.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Huh?
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
It is a fucking emergency.
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
Yeah?
Shit yeah!
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
This driveway.
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
Yeah?
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Are you employed, sir?
Well we--I don't--
Well. . . yeah.
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
Someday.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Time.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Just out connecting a few dots.
Thought you were dead.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Too bad you're out of it.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Any casualties?
Two so far.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
You're wrong.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
You're joking --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
But, he could've --
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
You don't know that.
Look closer.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You get used to the darkness.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
I was afraid that might happen.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
Let's talk to your husband--
Who?
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
<u>Yes</u>.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
Anna--
I don't know. Nightmare.
--Cotter's--
I guess, yeah.
Then I'm going--
--no one'll ever know.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
Four in the morning?
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
I do.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What?
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Still don't see it--
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
--turn the camera off--
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--oh, Jesus--
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
I can't!
Why?
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
--no.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Okay.
Elly Kedward?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
--fuck Anna!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
Sort of...
Meurice--
On the phone. Was it for you?
...Huh?
Yeah? What happened?
In the trunk.
Thanks.
What?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
How long did you watch her?
Most of the night...
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Thanks Meurice.
Tuesday.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Only you. and the photo lab.
You want to see him too, right?
Then, shut up!
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Yes, I like you.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Do you know?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
That's good.
Sure I do.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Do you love me?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I did. are you?
I think I better go.
It's okay. it's okay.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Yes.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I don't know.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah. but.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay. okay.
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
Just some fatherly advice.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Be right down.
Alright.
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Yeah. okay.
I'll get a coat for her.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
What?  Yeah, sure.
Excuse me?
We want some grass.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
It's your grass.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Not really, no.
Murder.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Good night.
Because they caught me?
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
Touche.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
I love you too, man.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Family.
Yeah, well...
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
I know.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Put that shit away, they're here.
I said, I've seen it before.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
George, he wasn't asking.
What?
You mean, like a trip?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You swear?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I swear on your life.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
And here?
Sid Ahmed.
Second district ...
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
What ... What must I decide?
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Yes, a name for the operation.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Then you can go.
Cause?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
You've been following me?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
She left me.
She didn't.  She just left.
Did you ever see her again after that?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Do you remember his exact words?
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Then you would have gotten your money?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
No.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
You take a lot for granted.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
It's only the beginning.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Shoot him.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
I love you too, Dad.
I can back it up.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
I'm not.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Please -- not now.
I don't know.
It had to get there somehow.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
What?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Heat is heat.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Francesca. Robert.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Clean?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I don't think you're normal.
When?
Woman friends, too?
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Am I interrupting anything?
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
No. I can't. Not yet.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Why do you say that?
I had a temper.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
What about your husband?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
It's only four days.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Just some flies.
What it will be.
I said, no thanks.
Where we'll always be...
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Patrick, he's...
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
But the place burned to the ground.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Two point one seventy-six.
Open the case!
Where's what?
Yeah, I know.
Gimme the gun.
Give it to me.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
Why?
The money?  The money's gone.
I need you ...
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
What happened to them?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
Everything you couldn't.
I should have let him kill you.
Go right ahead, sir.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Lick me.
No.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Truck.  Of course.
My pleasure.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
You think I'm lying?
Then what?  Exactly.
He hung it up.
To let it dry.
Good.
...  shit.
Yeah.
Fine.
Not Caesar.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
...  Me neither.
Violet?
I don't know what we're talking about.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
Treadstone?
Yes.
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
That's all I get?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Get the kids out!
-- sir? --
One moment, sir.
Yes.
His brother.  You know his brother?
You don't want the police any more than I do.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
For twenty thousand dollars.
What if I say no?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
I was shot twice in the back.
Where are we?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- let me do this, okay? --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
But the police --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
Think I could rent a scooter?
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
-- I'm on it --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
That'll solve all our problems.
Where am I?
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
... have a look.
...sabotage!
... yer ducts.
You must save the day.
Layton.
Well, I ...
SAM! What a surprise!
What is it?
How much do you know?
Enough though, eh?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Why?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Jack ...
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Who are you?
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Well, no system is.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Your face ... are you hurt?
Tuttle?
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
27156789/074328/K.
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
Can I forget it?
I never signed the form.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
What?
You want to take my console into your office?
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
I ... uh ...
Er, yes ...
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
But I could be anybody.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
What is it?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
What do they want you or?
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
We are virgins.
Where is she?
She asked me to pick her up.
Mary, we really have to go.
What about Kanita?
What did you say?
Sure, sure, give go.
Oh man, Bucky.
I guess there's always a chance.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
He's working a double shift.
I'll be right down.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
You married?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Okay.
I need to sit down a minute.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
I need a drink, that's all.
What's that, Frank?
Backup?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
I quit! I'm through!
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
He was tough. You did all you could.
Look out!
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
No shit.
Relax, will you.
Used to be my partner.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
You write this?
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
There are only ten.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
No?
And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
They booted me out of Washington.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Why?
Yes.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Yes.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Sit down, stop.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I'm gonna go look at it again.
So I quit.
No.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
Yes?
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
I spent a fortune on this.
We could...
No stop where he's all besieged.
You talked me into it.
Bad manners.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
You don't have to finish tonight.
I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
I'll wait for you till seven.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Well, what is it?
Why, you need me for the story?
No.  Were you going to you?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Great.
Well, when?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
I knew what you meant.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Not anymore!
I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
I didn't finish talking to you!
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Carla...
Walter!  Jeez!
Bye!
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
What are you trying to say?
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
It was.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Why not?
Good night Walter.
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
You are?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I thought you didn't respect money!
Oh, OK.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
I'm hungry.
I mean it.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Which way did she go?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Jealous?
So I noticed.
I am so sure.
Well, stay here tonight.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
I should have known.
) What do you think?
Please.  It's so '91.
Get a boob job.
I forgot.
I'm looking for you, actually.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
None of your business.  God.
This is it.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Who we gonna beat?
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
Not if you're careful.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
It isn't important.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
I can't work this.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Football is my life.
And where are they now?
He knows who I am!
Thank you very much.
Sorry.
Nicole...
Later for it.
So very much.
I don't understand.
You are much more.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
My right nostril?
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Yes I do...
What a nasty thing to say.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
What'd he say?
I'll be back when we lose.
it's okay..
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
We all deserve to wear white.
I'll learn.  C'mon--
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Aren't we all?
Who?
You need a nickname.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
You a God damn witch?
You missed him!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
I thought I was--
Gimme that.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
My right.
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
No.
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
Crash, shut the door.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
Struck out eighteen...
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
You were wandering around.
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Speeding?
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
702 472 1862.
Right away.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Well...
Help, Daddy!
Mommy.
Matter of fact...
They payin'?
Honey, come here.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Four aces, Doc.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
Okay.
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yeah.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
...don't do it to me...
It's none of my business?
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Sammy.
Nick?
How'd you know I was here?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
I'll come by.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Oh, no.
See you, Ginger.
But mostly...
Good luck.
Yeah, I know all that.
Yeah.
It's chinchilla.
Oh...
What are you talkin' a- ?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
What?
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
I don't need one.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
And...
Okay?
At the most, which is impossible for him.
I put her to bed.
I had a... salad.
She had the same.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
Oh, sh-
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
If she calms down...
They had all the pieces they needed.
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
This is not the way to treat people.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Sam?
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
Nicky, I did -
We can't help him if -
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Am I right?
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
Yeah.  Thanks.
I don't - 
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
Sure did.
Exactly.  He hates me.
All right, all right.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Do you know that?
Promise?
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
They checked in alone.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
But he never talked.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
They'll do it.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
You sure?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
There's a lot of people here.
This looks promising...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Spear.
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Hey, I thought...
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Taking messages.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Not this minute.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
And that was the end of it?
Well you did.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I'm trying to.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Not a chance.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
L.A.P.D.
What's that supposed to me?
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
How about "later?"
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
You mustn't hang up.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
It's your call.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
I'm backing up.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
Who's this?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Are you busting my chops or what?
Let me talk to the lady again.
Hold on.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Whatever you say.
Good thing in a man.
I would expect he does.
Jimmy.
It's Dave.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
He's Scottish, Col.
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Why?
Maybe.
Something I heard someone say once.
No...
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Sure I do.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Sorry.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Stop it, Jimmy.
You could say that.
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
I was trying to get out of something.
Prescription. For my condition.
He asked me to see were you all right.
Will I see you again?
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Please, Dil --
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Aha.
Can't.
You're never out, Fergus.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
You sure about that?
I know that.
Aye, I do, Peter.
So it's on the street.
So, what do I look like?
Do what?
Kill me.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
Why can't we?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
No.
What?
Suppose you could say that.
What the fuck were you doing here?
Shouldn't take it personally.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Tree.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
My special friend.
You liked her?
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
No.
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
You won't run.
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
That's right.
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
It's all right -- look.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Of course there is!
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
No!
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Only we call them agents.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Thanks very much.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Oh.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
But no one actually saw him die.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Brian.
Oh.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
The view had better be worth it.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Your --
I met a man with sharp nails.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
I'm not fifteen.
There, you said it.
Tuesday.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
I'm sorry.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
What do you mean?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
And the last one?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
No -- in my room.
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Good for you.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Is your husband with you?
Thank you.
Come on. You can't stay here.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
You mean you and me?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
How do you shave in there?
On the street where you live.
How would you like a spanking?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
What?
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Good night.
Yes?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
What's the matter, chrie?
We will separate -- you look over there.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
So?
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
I will. Is that all?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
St. Michael's.
Really?
You know about that too?
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
He says he loves me.
No!
NO?!
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
No.
Ok.
No.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Mom?
Not that I know of.
The library. I'll be fine.
Attacked how?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
His mother's side.
Hi Sandy.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You can't bring it.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
If sheep don't count.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
He could've called first.
Huh?
...-tana.
All right.
You are not takin' my truck!
What the hell's goin' on?

...-er.
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
Okay, okay! 
Take your gun!
...work!  It's not even load-...


...you.
 Yeah...
I did not steal the truck.

You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
...do we?
Come on, old Pete.
 

 Go, go.
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
These'll keep it cold.
All right, let's go.
...to him!  You don't know who...
I'm a dangerous man!
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.



You know what I'm sayin'?
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
We got two paddles.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
Yeah.
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!

Come here.
Go, go, go! 

Okay.
  I've got the real thing!
What?

Why'd you stay behind?!


Who had to put a gun to your head?
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I think so too.
 Yeah.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
...within five minutes.
But...

I did what I could for you...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
  Hey, actually...

What the hell's a sage?
I'd say we're about even.

If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
Good to see you again, Leo.
I'll do it.
INT. LONG'S CAR - NIGHT.

Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Right.  Tim Mason.

Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...

I don't know what the hell...
It won't be long, gentlemen.

And don't give him any ice cream...
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
There's something else too.
Secrets.
All right, let's move...
Negative.  Negative.

All right.  Enough. Look...
It must've happened right after we left.

Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
...-son.

...and that power...
And what if it does?

Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
I'm at mile marker...
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
EXT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.


INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Take it easy, Jake.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Row twenty-three, section C.
That's right.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Thanks.
That's too bad.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
His girlfriend?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Is she all right?
Where is she?
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
You've got her? Where?
What are you talking about?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Why?
The apple core club.
The apple core?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Mr. Gittes.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
It wasn't much of a lie.
Where you were when your husband died.
You were seeing someone, too.
That your maiden name?
So you married your father's business partner?
Over the water department, or over you?
What dam?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
...No. Why was it.
Your eye.
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
Where are you going?
You saw my fa... father? When?
She's not tied up!
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
I want to see her.
What did you do that for?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
He's in the dark room.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
I'm sorry, I --
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
I'm afraid so.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Water and Power?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
She ran away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
What's she like? What's she like?...
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
I didn't see that.
I can't take shorthand.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
That's a long story.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Who said anything about brooms?
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
But Mr. Kane, I meant -
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
We haven't heard from him.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
I know that, Emily -
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
At night?
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
I see! 
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Yes, sir.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Yes?
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
That's the train with all the lights.
Yes.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Yes.
Queer?
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried.
What the hell is that?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You're kidding.
Just now.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
It's not what you think.
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
How do you know that?
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
I can pass!
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Are you open?
Yeah.
Oooh! Navy Seals!
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
She called me.
Five years.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
She called you Brad?
What do you mean?
Your mother.
You know what I just watched?
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Yeah.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Basically.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
So?
Perfect dozen.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
I guess not.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Gatorade.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Reach what?
Just... go! Go open the video store.
Why should I loan you my car?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
Hey, what about Veronica?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You're a snake.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
What time did we go to the funeral?
Why do I have this life?
Thirty-seven.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
Why do you say that?
To talk to you.
You need a ride?
Got one. Just pulled up.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
To you?
We were going to start again, I think.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
The white kind.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Ooh! Can we?!
How flattering.
Twelve.
Three including you.
You've only had sex with three different people?
All right. Name it.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
He requested this?
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
What is it?
What're you talking about?
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
Randal...?
It stings a little.
What's this?
WHAT?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
No way!
Because he's out of shape.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
I like the way you think.
Well, how about these two movies? 
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
You hope what feels good?
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
You're not?
Which one?
Dental School.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
I will. Take it easy.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Who's shooting?
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
I don't know.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
So, what do you see?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
The money!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Look, I know--
Would you?
Not on that leg.
Hi, Gabe.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Sure you can.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Yeah, let's go.
You know me, I'm a night person.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
You attacked me.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Cute.
Next time, date only basketball players.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
There is.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
You're looking at him.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
My wife... Alex freezes.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
I beg your pardon?
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
I did, sir.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
No, sir.
Vitamins will it be then?
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Yes!!!
Yes?
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Are you feeling better?
Thank you.
What?
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Yeah.
Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
In my office?
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
I think...
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Elvis?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Try?
Of course!
What am I gonna do with flowers?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
What's he sayin'?
Yo, whassup?
I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Max?  I'm Vincent.
I don't think I can do this.
I tried it.
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
How?
I can't believe this.
Because I have a gun and I say so.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Collateral damage.
Yes, Max?
I'm not catching a melody.
No.
Leave me alone.
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
Dmitri?
In case he asks.
Makes two of us.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
What's at Union Station?
That's what you said...
What happened to you?
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Do you still ride?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
Really?
I can't promise you anything.
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
Believe you about what?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Right here in Manhattan.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Did you kill my father?!
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Then tell me what happened.
Back where?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Because he believed me.
They'll trace it.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Without a love of my own.
Top pocket...  Go on.
Now she tells me.
That's great.  Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
I'm leaning toward no.
Whatever.
<u>Why you</u>?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
Is that your official response?
By our standards... yes.
I can't move any smaller.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
Can you show me?
That isn't the way it works.
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
That's my girl...  Lights.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Peter.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
What day?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Now you know.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
-- I don't know --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
But --
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
I'm leavin' the place to John.
I... I... I...
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
She's got him! You hear that?
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
You phony creep!
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Get out!  All of you!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
He was lying.
I don't have it...
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
She don't want it.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
That's no surprise.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
Who came in after you?
Because it's your job, that's all.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Because I think I'm wrong.
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Thank you.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
It's about time.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Have you seen his penis?
I'd like to go back. James...
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
What?
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Really?
It'll be fine.
That's thanks to all your help.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
I've already made arrangements.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I answered these questions last night.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
What's my rap?
My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
I don't like lamb.
Lie down.
So, it's over?
Aren't you ever quiet?
You're so wrong.
I'll see you tonight.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Congratulations.
Why'd you tell?
Letty, please.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
You should go.
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
I mean tonight.
Especially now.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
So will you?
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Who?
I heard about your friend.
Michael.   Yes.
I'm glad you're doing well.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
It's me...
You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.
Should I call you back?
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Okay.   How much?
Why are you here?
Good word.
Yes.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
I assume you want something?
You want me to help you get out of the country?
How about if I call you?
You have something for me?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I think he's already figured that out.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
What'd you get?
I will.
You better.
I'm from Belgium.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Hard to say.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
The hell it is.
Uh huh.
No thank you.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Glenmorangie.
What does arresting us get them?
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
A car.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
Shut up!
Long.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Let's end this here.
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
Give me back my comb.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
They make you fart.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
Well, how's your friend?
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Another jolly nickname?
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
Yes.
Go away.
I'm already alone.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
Forever.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
I sincerely doubt it.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
No thank you.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
And you promise to abide by it?
What?
Okay?
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
I don't.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Hi.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Any ideas who it could be?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Doctor King is my favorite.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Eyes closed.
Did you hide the letters?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Well what then?
Well did you like it?
Cool.
But I thought high school is only four years.
He'll love it.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
I'm taking a shower.
I do.
Would you please leave.
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Likewise I'm sure.
What do you mean?
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
I see your point... though why should I care?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Interesting.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Cecile.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Exactly the opposite.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Kind of.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I want to fuck.
Get out!
It's Cecile.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Excuse me?
Nope.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Don't worry about it.
You're a lucky guy.
What do you mean?
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?
At the old house with the voice.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
Well, it seemed to me --
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
Yes, daddy.
I didn't forget.
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
Why didn't you run after them?
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
This is more fun than just pretend.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
I shall wear it in my hair!
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
May I pet the deer?
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
But I only came to give back the ring.
No, thank you.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Good.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Nearly four.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
Why would they exaggerate?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
It is so hot in here.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
Ignore it.
Hide him.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
You're such a good friend.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
Frida? You okay?
Knock what off?
Yes I do have to pee!
Uh huh. So pee.
Yeah?
On your desk.
No?
I can forgive you a bestseller.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
A man killed in Central Park.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
What's that supposed to mean?
No, but thanks for the warning.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Thanks.
You got a dog?
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
His wife.
Just visiting my patient.
He's seriously disturbed...
Loose ends?
Yes.  This way.
How could you have been so stupid?
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
Which one?
You seem restless.
Then we must call the police.
Please...
Maybe.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
A month.
... Alright.
Alan
Don't call the Vice President!
I don't give a shit.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Mild stroke?
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
And...
Clean.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
He's only doing what you told him to.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
So what do we do?
That'd be great.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car?
What?
Dave...
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
We vetoed that?
Wrong...
Alan...
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
We'd like to hire you.
You made their funding disappear!
Home.
You1re leaving, too?
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
Yeah... Bedtime.
You really believe that?
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
What you wanna do?
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
It's because of me.
MARY!
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
I don't think they're in school.
Yeah.
Yes sir.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
But...
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
All right.  I'll second that.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
You know,
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
You are?  She's glad I called!
No.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
You can't be in here.
But I love you.
Uh-huh.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
It's just for a little while. You promised.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Yes sir.
All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Father, I--
Todd Anderson.
A play, dummy.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
It's my birthday.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
How soon can we get up and running?
I have a schedule...
It ain't any better out there!
You hear that?
What are those things?
I don't know...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
The "come back" kind.
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
You don't take orders very well, do you?
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
And what have you come up with?
How does an island sound to you?
Nowhere...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Fuckin' A!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
It's Nick!
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
You don't!
I do!!!
You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
Yeah.
Everybody love Linda.
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Biederman!
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Linda, Linda...!
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
But --
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Nick.
Fucking A.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
From Nam?
Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son!
Oh.
Yeah.
What are you, God?
What else?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
What do you mean?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
No. No way!
Here! This is it!
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
I gotta get back, Nick.
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Up.
Down.
I'd think about it.
Kimberly!
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Fuck you - fuck you.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
That wasn't your plan, was it?
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
How do I look?
Aces.
Nobody's looking.
Are you a cop?
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
Pass.
I'll be okay.
Good night.
Yes, sir.
Then find me some cigarettes.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
You treat her nice.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
That's my problem, Belle.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Anybody can see that.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
But I like the new one better.
That's just too bad --
Not me! 
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
Don't say that -- I know it is --
The seventh day of April --
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Morning, Jabez.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Headache -- Squire?
You really think so?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Mary -- it's gone.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Mary -- what would you do?
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Isn't that your own fault?
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
It don't matter!
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
I object.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
So, you divorced of what?
But meant her moving here.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
Not any more.
The police...?
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
Put it down now.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Yessir.
Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
No.  I never smile any more.
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Well, how'll I get home?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Yeah... I know.
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Well...
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
I like that... yeah!
I don't have a choice.
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Right.  See you sometime.
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
What do you want to know that for?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Okay, give us the women.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
The girl hostages.
I'll see what they'll do.
You tryin' to fuck me?
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
We're bringing in your wife...
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Sure - we like you.
Yeah.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Yes...
... The bodies out the door.
But do you mean it?
But I want to know what you think.
Does that still go?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Have him walk in backwards.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Okay.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
Gimme the black guy...
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
... Just give me time to think...
Sonny - Here's your document.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I said you were never a faggot.
Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?
Newsman, not ...
How much?
Yes.
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
<i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
No. Please enlighten me.
Must you use that awful word?
Cunt.
I was a musician.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
Nobody.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
Yes?
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
Two dollars!  Forget it!
No, you the man.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
That's it?
Fifty cents.
I'm working.
You are too crude.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
Motherfucker you.
So when is all this ice suppose to melt?
Can ya dig it?
C'mon, Sal.
Sal, I want my money.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Christmas came early.
Do I love you?
How long then?
Later for you.
Meda.  Meda.
Tina, I'll be right back.
I didn't know you could read.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
Ya like him, huh?
Yeah.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I love you, my brother.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
I'm listening.
Tell Vito.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Don't start on me today.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
O'clock?
Yeah...
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
So boys, how was your first day?
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Probably because we've never met.
Cool.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
You can't marry my mom.
I don't think so.
You have beautiful eyes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Yeah, that's why I asked.
Sorry, no further questions.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
And like she said, do it before the parade.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
And with that complete loser
Right.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I'll talk to you later.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Can you believe it?
That's the downside. There is none.
Uh-oh. Harry?
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
Yes you are. 
And...?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
This is my son, Paul.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
Yes.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Excellent!
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Ha!
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
The <u>women</u>?
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
I am always on time.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Dracula?
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
But maybe not.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Formaldehyde.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Eddie, how was I?
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Rolling.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
These shoes are itchy.
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
I thought he was dead.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
For this one, we need $60,000.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
That's not true --
Really?!  Well good for you.
Hruphh...?
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
I think you're quite handsome.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already presold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
So you're not a fruit?
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Who?
Isn't he dead?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
Yeah...?
You know, to make the legs move --
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Do they show it?
No! Do they show you having sex?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yeah, so... ?
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Went --
What?!
You know what would be great?
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Leave her be.
Good luck.
Yes?
Who?
Al!
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Who?
Mom?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
Shari, Ray feels --
Well, when will she be back?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
I batted!
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
Yeah, well...
Why?
Everybody hates me!
Look at this.
Ed?
I'm sorry.
No. It's your fault.
Come on.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
I'm doing all right.
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Who's Shari?
I was in jail.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
What?... Why?
What is? Oh, dinner!
Ed?
How?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
What kind of person?
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
I think we've got a problem.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Hello, Tracy.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Doing what?
Would you sign it for me?
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Oh.  Okay.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Exactly when?
And how did you get in the school?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
So?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Till 19-fucking-70.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Yes.  But do you know?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
It's Lynn.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
Did they deserve it today?
I don't know.
It's Bud.
That simple, huh?
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Call me Dudley.
<u>What do you want</u>?
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
What was that boyfriend's name?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
Which one are you and which one am I?
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
<u>Lynn</u>.
No.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
More.
More's gonna cost you.
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
Until he gunned down six people.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
So be it.
His blood's always up.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Okay.  I'll do it.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Yeah.  My whole life.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
What are you talking about?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
On what evidence?
Officer White?
Under the house.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Sid, how are they hanging?
A bootleg...
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
Oh Jesus.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
We said a hundred.
Jesus!
I called from a payphone!
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Why'd you leave?
Looks like Detroit.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
What's going on?
Why?
Those are Feds.
I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
Goddammit--
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Reynolds.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Thanks.
Because my life is being ruined.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I can't.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
Well, you know--
I see her for business.
Leave this house.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
What happened to your head?
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
That's okay.
I was missing you.
My suitcase is gone.
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
Brill.
Brill?
How can I be sure.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
Rachel--
You have to.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
Otherwise you may have to what?
She's in the kitchen.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Just be cool.
Christ!
Calm down.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
So do I!
Yeah?
Yeah, what's going on?
Yeah.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If they've looked at the video.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Then let's assume I don't.
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
Which stall?
Excuse me?
I don't want to go back.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
Her or me?
I do not.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Look over there.
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
I believe you still have my book.
Good.
What?  No!
You bastard, I was believing you!
A surprise, he said.
We've got to get you out of here.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
Her hands and feet were tied.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
I was talking about the girl.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Shut-up!
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
I don't know.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
I don't know what that means.
And you've forgotten yours.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
No, now I can't kill you.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
To arm-twisting.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Candaules
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Could I have a cigarette?
Your friend?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Thank you.  Thank you.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
I follow the wires.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Yes.  Later.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
And what if he really is a spy?
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
This was your garden?
Through a window.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
You got a better idea?
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Who am I?
That is of no interest.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
I sincerely hope so.
So alive.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
I never carry...baggage.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
In a week.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
Yes you did.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
One more item--not on the check list.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
You're not on the beat.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Shut up.
There is no big job.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
Right. The eight billion.
A parting gift from the Empire.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Can't be too careful.
Surgically attached.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
You look like George Washington.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Remind me why.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Who?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
They did?
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
A number for the whole group, or for us?
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Find out.
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Yesterday.
Corey.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
That's right.
Ross.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Well I hate it.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
You got a little girl?
Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
I'm just saying --
What do you want, a joke?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
About what?
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
That's okay.  I understand.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Barks his agreement.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
Our destruction?  Who?
He will join us or die, My Master.
It can wait.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
What is it?
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
You're going to attack them?!!!
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
Hyperdrive.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
What is it?
Closer?!
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
But tell me why ...
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
They're...pretending to dress.
Believe what?
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
With food?
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
I like you.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
We'll see.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Call me Snake.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Where'd they go?
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Where?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
I cannot--
It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
Guenevere...
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
What is it my child?
Rise, Mordred.
I'm going.
Not you, my husband?
Can it truly be used for magic?
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Just show the sword.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
I?
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Well what's wrong?
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Just five or six people.
Didn't who tell me?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
I can't believe it.
Phonograph.
Me too.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
I just heard them Karl.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Yes, I think so.
A stimulant.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
About my daughter?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Could you see her?
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
No.
No
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Cause I like it.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Oh, honey.
No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
I've seen it.
No.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Who are you?
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Amen
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I've seen him.
Really?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Yes.
I don't know.
You're not going to drive!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Little slow tonight.
It's all there.  Both nights.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
No bones?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
How's the birthday girl?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Recognize these two characters?
Jack...
No thanks.
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
You're getting cold feet about this.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
I didn't get her number.
She'll get here.
Yeah.  Something.
So what do you think?
Day.  Wednesday.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Right.
Good idea.
Yeah.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
What?
The party's over.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
You're making things up, Frank.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
Be reasonable, Jack.
Just until we find another girl.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
What's it for?
I don't know.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
Fuck you.
Later.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
All right.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
Yes, it is.
My watch is broken, too.
So run a little longer.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
Where's my name?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
That!  You can't wear that!
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
I said I was sorry.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Jack?
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Smells like fish.
Huh?
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Job.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Black.  Labrador.
Downstairs.
He leads, I follow.
I suppose.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
You want me to walk you?
Nothing personal --
Can't sleep?
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
What'd I say?
Friend.
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
I didn't want to wake you.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Ever go to church?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Fine.  You?
Oh, fine.
You mean if I get sick?
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
... Thanks.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
I'm late for surgery.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
You said it, Jon, not me.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
Call me spontaneous.
-- Studying.
I don't know.  Maybe...
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
Whats going on here?
Thats right.  Okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Ill run into the linen store...
Who did?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
I never won anything in bowling.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Everyone needs something.
Me?
Basically, its my car now.  Get in.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.
Its lovely...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Uh huh...
Uh-huh...
All in one tape?
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Because thats where I live.
Youre having a bad day, Ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there...
Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
She got those shoes...
I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
Thats why I work for Big Ed?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
No, open it...
How do you even know about this place?
Are you sure?
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
What are you talking about, Jack?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
To Paris. Paris, France.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
If it's something you feel strongly about.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I like the sound of that.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
And they're changing into...
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
Oh, it is.
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Sure.
Ben did this.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
If it happened to him, then it could...
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
No...
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
And if it should take more time to get through --
A surgeon might...
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Nothing -- against all that force.
I've done all I could with the laser.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
The Breath of God...
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
What about Dr. Michaels?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Uh -- what?
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
Is this a fucking joke here?
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
What the heck d'ya mean?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Oh, yah, I know that!
You have children?
Officer Olson.
Yah, right-o.
White Bear Lake?
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Uh-huh.
And what about the other fella?
Oh, yah?
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
No. No, ma'am.
Okay.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Well... yah.
Where're you going?
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
2:30.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
No, see -
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Yah.
Oh, pretty good.
I see that! That's great!
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
It's okay...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Norm?
The day of our homicides.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Not on your feet too much?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Hmm?
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
I want that.
The girl had done her homework.
Do you care?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
I'm sorry, but I...
Who's this?
... You know me?
Who do you think I am?
Pardon me?
...no ...no ...
What list?
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Yeah.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
No, I...
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
This fight, pussy.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Hemingway.  You?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
That was three times you promised.
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
A liposuction clinic.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Fucking sweet.
Imagine how he feels.
... is over.
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I'm you?
Answer me, Tyler.
This isn't possible...
What about Marla?
...stop me?
If you know, I know.
You want out?
I quit.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Noooo, please...
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Let go of me!!
How'd you know?
Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
You were there?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
Hold on.
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How do you know?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
I'm... really sorry.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Right. April 25th.
Most kids never have it happen.
Get out! Get out of the car!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
No harm. No foul.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
That's what I'm doin'!
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
I need a vacation.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Nothing we can do, man.
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
I thought he was with you.
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
I couldn't get you in.
Let's get that tent down!
We just take pictures?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
What?
I know.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
Mind if I sit down?
I could take it or leave it.
Am I out of here?
There were treating me like a headcase.
Those men are all dead.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
You still believe in God?
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
The moron?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
What does that mean?
No, it's not... Come here...
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
You can ask.
No, I have to work.
I was nine in the sixties.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
A list.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
How much?
Sshhhh!
A quest?
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Out where?
I did, didn' I, El?
Now, hand...
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Bobby, don't talk like that...
Sure...
How do you know it's clean?
You want me to hold the chicken.
Well, you seem very professional...
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
Now don't...
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
That's good.
No.
Very nice.
What?
No...
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
Where's Catherine?!
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Then after that?
What?
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Some bath oil?
Shut up...
Is he?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
I don't think that's true.
It is true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
There's some good things on it, though.
Well, she was.
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
Just get the fuck outta here.
Victor.
Wussup.
Of course.
So what's her name?
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I can't!
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Wussup, Victor.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Where you goin'?
Which one?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
Um, yeah I think so.
Positive.
Your friend must be misinformed.
How do I know you're not lying.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
You mean her.
I wasn't asking.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
It was planted on me, sir.
Not a prayer.
That's Babar.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
There is?
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?
What?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Oh my God!
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Whoops.
Well, I'm fully covered.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Since he moved to L.A.
Where are you going?
I know.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Why not?
Who?
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
I have the same problem with my help.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Can I steal you for a minute?
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Yeah.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
His bride. Cute as a button.
How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Preoccupied with what?
I ordered lunch.
Can I ask you a question?
Why'd you let me in?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Long story.
That's what I want to know.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
They're trying to kill me!
Come here.
Very good sir.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I never read the paper.
You broke it? You know the source?
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Fletch.
Jim Swarthout?
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Who?
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Great pipes.
Right away!
Exactly.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Contacts.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Like me.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
The case!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Say cheese...
What about Don?
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
You don't use shit?
Cause if I do.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Goodbye.
Pour moi?
Non!
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
S'right.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
You're for real?
Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
Yeah, I know.
You want some eggs.
Who's on him?
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Not a chance.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Darling, may I have this one?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
You know what I'm saying.
They around?
I seem nervous, huh?
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
He ain't the only one.
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Nah, I gave it up.
It's Mom.
Whatta you mean...
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
H-hi.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
How'd you know my name, mister?
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Uh, huh.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
A hot shot, huh?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Where are you going?
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
I don't know...
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
Why don't you help us?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Gulp!
Stop the car!  Now!!
It was nothing.
I have to.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
I wish it was.
Happy Friday the 13th.
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
No.
Which is?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
Please don't do anything crazy.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
I'm here.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
You need to leave.
Not so bad, today.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
So's he and he knows it.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Tell me!
That's all right.  I was just...
Oh my God, Steven.
Don't do anything stupid.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Yeah.
Right.
This is Jason's fault!
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Where is she?
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
I...I can't...
I don't know what to say...
You are going where?
Alla puttanesca.
I don't want to hear about it.
Quietly effective.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
She wants a divorce.
Tonight. What's tonight?
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
No, we're not.
She was very evasive.
Did you see the winning run score?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Can he get through it?
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I have a class. I'm late.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
What did it say?
I'm at the door.
I lost it. I lose everything.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Matthew's my grandson.
You're charming the boy.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
I want to believe.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
You're out of bullets.
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Why?
Sidney.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
What color?
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
Is it true?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
I thought you were against fighting.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
Even as a boy I thought so.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
No.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
The fools!  Sorry...
Well, that's one victory.
Ahh.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
Where do we start?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
The Mission Director.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
You know I'm scared of heights.
I'm sure I could have.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Why not?
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
We could go together one day.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I can't do this.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I'll take care of my end.
Hi.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Just like old times?
No. It's been a long time.
It's just been a while.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Is he straight?
For exits off Main Street.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
Texas is a big state.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
You and me.
What's wrong?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
I never have any luck.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
What about you?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Whatever you need.
Can't leave the desk.
Not now.
You serious?
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
That's what matters, isn't it?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
How?
What's it got to do with you?
What name?
Good evening.
Confidential, like.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
I can't Jack. How can I?
Yes you can.
Address?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
What about?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Though nicer than most?
What was bugging Frank?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
While he was here. You went about together?
And what was that?
We're there now.
Tell me about the girl.
Yeah.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Yeah.
Where's that?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
It'll cost you.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Ta-ra.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
No, I didn't know that.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Sod off.
Piss off, Ray.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
I have to. Things to see to.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Three hundred altogether?
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
...they hold on to their money...
I had to.
I...I don't know.
...this shit...
You get a bad month, all of a...
I, I...I...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Yes.
What?
Just the act.
You build it!
That's what I...
Should do something to them.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
What did he say?
For five thousand?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Why would they come to me?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
No.
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
I didn't ask to be.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
That's none of your fucking business...
In the abstract...
Uh-huh.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
What?  You can't do any what?
They aren't?
No.
We had a robbery. 
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
Go to lunch, will you...
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Get in the goddamn room.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...do you want to go downtown...?
Not lately it isn't.
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Can't do it.
I can't split them.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.
It's not impossible.
Why I don't...
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
What sales?
Abso...
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
And did they steal the contracts...?
Last night, this morning.
Mmm.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Kenilworth...?
Yeah.
Did I...?
Who did she call?
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
It's not me, it's my wife.
Tell me again.
No, Jim.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
I...
This.
She told me not to talk to you.
What are the police doing here...?
When...
They took 'em...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
They--excuse me...
Aren't you going out today?
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
They were friends.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I'm not hungry.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
I understand...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
That's what I'm here for.
Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
What's that?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Yes.
Goddamn it, where were you?
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
Alright.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Sleeping inside me.
Why don't you sit down?
You haven't heard me.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
But times are different...
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Not good.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
After dinner.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
We got friends in the commission.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
It still hurt.  A lot.
What're you talking about?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
You will not hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Why?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Then you're as single as I am.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Just that I was in the Marines.
I stink to high heaven right now.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
What did she mean by going flooey?
What was wrong?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
What's to sketch?
You went to university?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
I liked it.  We all did.
No.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
Not me.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You're talking through your hat now.
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
Something happened to him?
You asked me to model.  Remember?
Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
I want -- I want...
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Need some help?
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Of course.
Oh dear.
She is beautiful.
Of course.  This afternoon.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
What rumors might those be?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
A boost. A big boost ...
Jesus ...
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
How is he?
You want to come along quiet?
Kip.
You know my back.
Your girl works in there ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
You mean the poor --
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
And there she is --
Yeah...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
That's a good one, Donny...
What are you doing back?
oh.
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Whatcha got left ... ?
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
You all right -- ?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Just hold-on there --
Yeah -
I heard you were pumping gas -
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
You?
You?
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
What era was that -- ?
Come here -
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
We're going shopping -- !
Call 'em here -- ?
What are you doing here?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
Mitch.
And you got some Italians -- ?
Hey -
That's what I want ...
Oh. Okay. Right.
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
I do ... I cut "em...
And Tracy's on the move ...
Bench seats.
Of course. Hi, Junie --
Is he still working here ?
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
Shit all looks the same here --
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Billy, how are you?
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
No more shines, Billy.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Nods.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Get inside!
It'll be okay.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Where's the stuff?
I flushed it down the toilet.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
It's been six months.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
Nah.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
No, no. It's okay.
I hate to do dishes.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
But, Paulie, please.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
Suck my cock!
I don't know yet.
Why not?
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
How'd you like that course?
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
It's touching me.
No students work for me.
Building two.
Yes. Under two conditions.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Hey, how you doin'?
I appreciate that.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
It's on the college.
You too, Gerry.
Why would he do that?
Not at all.
I been here a couple years.
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
He won't be a failure!
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Whatever blows your hair back.
Oh.
This is a real piece of shit.
No, I don't.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I kind of got that impression.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Okay...
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Yeah.
Bullshit.
Your house must have been a zoo.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Then let's go have some fun.
Exactly.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
All right, all right. We'll go.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Clearly.
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
I'll get Rosasharn.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Don't hold me so tight.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Fan-belt's shot.
Gallon or two?
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
Women?
Joad. Tom Joad.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
No, I never. What?
That's our place.
I ain't gonna run.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Naw--not much!
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
She'll be awright.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. 
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
What do you want to do?
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
You met people.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
What?
Jesus Christ!
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Will you come with me?
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
Say more.
Yes.
What stuff?
This is me breating.
Is that right?
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
Okay.
--Nooo--
It was the PLO.
Whatever.
Wait a minute--
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
I'll pay.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
It's fine.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
He gave me a great deal.
As long as you had a good time.
How did you get this job?
Wow.
How are you? How's business?
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Feel good?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
It is. It's lovely.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Just make yourself comfortable.
What?!
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Yeah?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I didn't know I had to.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
You already did.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
My period.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
Okay.
Why?!
Okay.
Night.
How are you feeling about work?
What do you mean?
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
I'd love to go there one time...
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Yes, it does.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Promise?
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
You!
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
That's what some folks say.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
You know her?
Yeah.
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
What does she do?
There's no hurry. Take you time.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
How much longer do you think?
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
What do you mean?
Yeah, cool.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
That's far out!
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Yeah, mom?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
That's bullshit.
What's going on?
How did you know that?
Yeah! Sure.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
You're not gonna win.
What?
It's my subway defense system.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
You think they're going to bust us?
Congratulations.
So?
I'll take you down there.
Its about tonight.
What's going on?
Look.
What does that mean?
We're trapped in this house.
Brady!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
How do you know their not?
About what?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
I don't want to.
Double scoops?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Yeah.
Dad, what's going on?
Just do it.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Right here, Ben.
This is 132, over.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Its true, Sheriff.
How do you know?
Be here in a minute.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
We just talked.
Annie, was that you?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I wasn't spooked.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He can still watch.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Thanks.
I can't.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Here, Lester.
No, he's not.
Come with me.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Will you call me tomorrow?
It's important.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
They may be right.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
They could be.
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
Is Annie around?
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Okay. Later.
Have a good time.
Yes.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
Mm-mm!
Mmm?
Oh, yeah.
Mmm.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It feels like you're in France.
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Fast.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
And it's just in one ear?
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Yes, but you name names.
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Everything's okay? 
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Oh, that's nice.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Poor Hannah.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
I know it isn't.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Was I?
I don't know.
I didn't say that.
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Yeah.
How can we be happy?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Hmm?
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Mm-hm.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh...
You know... 
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I bumped into your...
Do you miss Frederick?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Like what?
Oh, now-- 
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I know...I know.
Huh?
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Go right over there.
Wow!
What are you talking about?
I want to experience childbirth.
Okay, okay.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Yeah.
She really does, though.
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Easily.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
I hope.
So what's new?
My--uh...
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
I recall you.
I'm fine.
Oh, no.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
No, the reason I ask is--
You have.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Right.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Oh...
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
They're offering... 
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
How crazy is that.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Then I'm doing fine.
I know her by the Back.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Have the child taken to bed.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
No, no, of course not.
...young boys, still...?
Yes, I did.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
'fraid it's too late.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
I'm an orphan.
What'd you say, hon...?
...how so?
How so?
I have had the honor. 
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
I require...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Yes.... yes...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
What is that that smells so wonderful.
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
I am on the track of...
Because...?
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
...yes, yes, yes....
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
What does <u>that</u> mean?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Did you wait until you were 18?
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
Wha-at?  What is it?
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
How do you mean?                                            ]
That's not what I was worried about.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
Don't worry, you...
What do you want me to say?
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Ronnie!
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Hey, don't run away now.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Give it up girl!
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
Sure.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Yeah, great.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
French.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Incredible similarity.
Oh.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Did to.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
The bomb, asshole!
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Pretty weird.
Punch it in!
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Get a job.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
I'm educating myself!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Love, you can still write to each other.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Bull...
Skin cancer.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Ambrose. I know.
Zero's a number right?
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
I only married you for your body.
Where's my wife?
No please make yourself at home.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Who the hell are you talking to?
Two.
This game is over do you hear me?
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Really?
Well now there's a compliment.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
Often, uh.
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Mister LaPlante...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Uh, no.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
You do?
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
LaPlante!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
That too.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
I understand that.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Right.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Yeah, that was easy.
Isn't that always the way?
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
But it's what we want.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
There's no card or anything.
All new houses have noises.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Look, I think we should work things out.
Shut up.
It's fun.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
What did the thermometer say?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
-- A man.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Get outta here.
It's late.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Sing.
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
France.
Living.  Remember?
She's the King's cousin.
You.
I stood up first.
I lied.
Why not?
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
I'll be fine.
Jennifer.
New York is dangerous place.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
I wanted to get to know you better.
Conner?
How could they get by him?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
What will you do?
Why?
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
He knows better than that.
It's happening right now.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
How about the cop?
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Let me come get him.
I'm getting a doctor!
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
Yeah.
I still see that boy's eyes.
What I want is to help my father.
Mars?  What are you doing?
What are we going to do about Mike?
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Maddox!  You got that?
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Are all of you named Jones?
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
Yes, sir.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
What do you want?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
These disks . . . where are they?
Smith will know.
What do you mean by that?
We, who is we?
I'll be back.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
The police are very busy.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
Listen, you need me.
I am on a list! What list?
I committed no war crimes.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Thank God.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Just drive, Gregoire.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Why sir?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
He will be here.
Show me your ID
I will see what I can do.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
I couldn't help.
You could have asked for a favor.
Dawn. Then they go.
Where are you hurt, son?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Give him time.
But who is left?
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
In Ruhengeri?
Yes.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
I have to go to the Diplomat.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Who is this Simon?
On the street.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- bullshit --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Oh dear.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Poor Mr. Price --
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Take the gun.
No...not air --
We're safe?
It's succeeding!
Run.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- and who's next on your list?
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
And then what happens?
I think it's something better experienced then described.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
What're you talking about?
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Believe me, we need to.
How, he's supposed to be dead!
Something....happened --
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
You say you saw some activity here?
Suppose not.
By freeing them.
Well I bet you they're happy.
She's hiding.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
What will Aubrey think?
Ok.
Were you fooling with the power?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
I think everything's ready.
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
What about the other five percent?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Maura.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Yes, I am.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Did you remove anything in the cellar!
What's going to happen?
What?
I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
I know what I saw.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Then tell me what to do.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Right.  Right!
What is it?
That's great.
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
I miss you too.
Yes. 53
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
"Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
You sound disappointed.
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Too-do-loo, babe.
Ooh-kay...
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
A little petting is not the issue!
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh.  Well, what's this?
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Employer?  The president?
Shucks.  Guess not.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
I'm plenty happy!
I myself --
-- or lack thereof?
-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
...I'm sorry.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
You know, on farm route 17.
You don't say.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
Tell me about it.
I'm sure you do.
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Nah, that's all forgotten.
-- tough titty toenails!
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
You're fired.
Get your feet off that desk.
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
She looks in her purse...
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
I've never heard of a cure.
Yes.
But it's so far away...
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
I am not a frightened girl.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
And charming?
Wesley can be very entertaining.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
What about her?
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Elena.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Stuffed and baking.
What do you mean?
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Well?
All right.
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
C'mon.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Let me.
Hi Wendy.
Of course.
Forget how to ride a bike.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
But not too ashamed.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Am I right or am I right?
No!
The Idiot?
Great, thanks for the tip.
Then why'd you come after me?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
There's a TV in the basement.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
What time is it?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Right.
That's all, for now.
Yeah.  All over.
Twelve years younger.
Okay.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
We'll get the other one, though.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
What?
He's asking everybody questions.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's not what he thinks.
Huh?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
Long as it's fun.
What was?
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
The phone call.  The knapsack.
Did you have sex with her?
He.  Well, he...
There's nothing more to talk about.
Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
No, my beloved, my child.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
I can't save her.
No.
I didn't realise.
Is this my birthday?
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Come, Claudia...
Be still!
That's not so.
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
It's only mortal death.
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
Call him.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
I can't.
I don't know any hell -
Paris? You came from Paris?
As did the one who made me.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
You followed me here, didn't you?
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
You're not lying to me, are you?
The story about stakes through the heart?
What about coffins?
He did it to make you stay with him!
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
How could I not? She had to know.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
It's over, I'm telling you...
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
My daughter...
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
They never found the body.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Come on, you can make it.
Why are you being like this?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
You know me to well.
Who?
I told you.
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Right. Now I remember.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
What do you mean, Julie?
I wasn't dreaming.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
What is up with that weirdo?
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
In case you do so, would you --
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
All the graves?
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
No one can take my father's place.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
You have forgotten my last name?
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
Yes?
Her name is Thea?
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
I can't do that. These families have children.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Suicide.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Yes, but what happened to George?
What's that book you've got there?
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hiya, George!
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Hee-haw!
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Well then, how do you know?
Uh-huh.
Okay.  What's yours?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
He's pretty young for that job.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Hello, what am I bid?
Where are you going?
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Some other time, George.
It's important.
That way, huh?
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
The whole town's gone crazy.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Have you made up your mind?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
You forgot something.
What the hell.  For you....
With butter, if they got any....
No problem, no problem.
They're moving pretty fast.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
If there is, develop it!
Right.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
You want to come here a minute?
What else you got?
You're damn right that's what it is.
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
We don't know that, do we?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That's it.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
I did, I did.
What're you guys doing today?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Nothing.
Terrific.
Do you?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
I've never been supercargo.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Great.
Maybe.
Great!
Help!  Help!
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
3:30.
Give me back my hat!
Great.  I got some wine.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
With those camera lights and...
You buying?
No.
Want another one?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Yeah.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Just put your mask on.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Up.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
I know I can capture it.
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
What's up?
Sure.  Let's go.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
So tell Calvin.
What do you mean, we don't?
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Fine.  Have them do some.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
I thought they were clever.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
Ten minutes ago.
Thanks.
Someone's looking for you.
Come on!  Check this out!
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
What, hon?
Hold still, damn it!
Gotta sneeze.
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Yeah, poor bastard.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Got a job for me?
So was Dad.
Something wrong?
Don't hurry back.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Chicken....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
But it went away...We would have known....
It went away....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
I'm not doing anything.
I'm hungry, Mom....
You check it....
He heard that.
What's going on?
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Come on, I'll show you around.
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
Why'd you come out here?
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
I can't....
I don't know how....
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
Why?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Just like that?
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Still chasing fish?
I wish there was something I could do....
Feathers all over the place....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Try the area around the wreck....
Will you leave me alone...?
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
The females have eggs....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Gave them the day off....
We got it together, Jake....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
So did I....
Lots of times....
What?
How long have you known Hoagie?
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
'Snuck up on me....'
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Who grows more beautiful....
I'm training to....
Anything to do before I go home?
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Only me and Mom ..
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
I already did. What's his problem?
We're going.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I was wrong.
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
You looked like you did?
<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
That's bullshit,
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
What are you looking for?
Bullshit.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.
Why not? You heard my voice?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Which is what?
Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
No I'm not.
I wanna be near you ...
I don't want them to arrest you.
Yes, Sir.
What does that mean?
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
I know about the bachelor party.
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Do you have something to drink?
Sure --
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Happy. He said "happy?"
So I'll see you this weekend.
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
You want...
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Okay.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
No, I'm saying to be --
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
Rod, get on the camel.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Eric...
No, it's...
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
He could have died.
What about Eric?
DAD!
Sure.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
I try not to.
The last of my breed.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Goodbye, Alan.
Mine's new.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
But then you never get to go in space.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
John . . .
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
Possible.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Oh, God.
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
I think she's with Sarah!
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Think fast, Sarah.
No.
You're sure we have to?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
They died together?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
The Cretaceous.
It's my favorite.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
What's that?
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
Alan?
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
- - shut up.
Why not?
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Yes it is.
That's a good idea.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Try to!
I didn't say you were scared.
There's gotta be something - -
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Who?
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Let's get you out.
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
His camera... it's still recording.
Who's chest?
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Oh?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You're not going to be there?
How's that possible?
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
Think it'll do any good?
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
An empty tomb?
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You're just doing your job.
In a small way.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I've never seen you here before.
Have you looked?
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
Tonight?
He was murdered.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
It usually is.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
I photographed it extensively, father.
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
Leave it, Ann.
Jack!...  Jack!
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Why?
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Uh uh.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
Sure dear, yes.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
I guess he figured it was better.
-- Yes.
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
-- OK --
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
You said it was!
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
I don't like getting splashed.
I was wondering what that was.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Trask wants to talk with you.
They don't scare me any more.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
It's in the report.
No.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
I don't believe Tom's alive.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
He's in his room, playing.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
We use the green and yellow.
That's okay.
I'm allergic to onions.
You are not allergic of onions.
Then eat around it.
You mean for good?
See you in the morning light.
Right.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
No, she never did.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
No.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Did you wish to?
Eight, almost nine years.
No.
I don't recall.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I'm not taking him with me.
I don't know...
Yes...How's Billy?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Beautiful.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
I'm going to take it.
Fine.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Got it.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Any day.
Yes, Holiness.
Again?
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Me. First break of day.
I miss my brother.
How many?
Two.
Ask whatever you will.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Good day.
I leave tomorrow.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
I would not know. Maybe.
Ahh.
I do.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Completely.
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Oh, yes.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
Mr. Cyr!
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
'Night.
Good.  See ya soon.
That's probably good.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
I'm not mushing it.
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
Alright, Jack!
Okay.
Good idea.
You wouldn't?
You wanna ride in my truck?
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
This is a little different.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
It looks like a branch.
You threw it at me!!
<u>Apologize</u>?
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
What is this?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
She's worried about the cow now.
Me too.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
A tooth?
I want you to go there.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
<u>Kelly</u>--
<u>You</u>?
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Backstabber?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
He's here, Ardelia.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
I will... I promise.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Get me out!
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Not yet.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Point taken.
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It's much better than your shoes.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Yes.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Two months.
Why so briefly?
No.
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
You knew them.
Your "father"?
Yes. I want you to go.
Alice?
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
I am sorry, Duncan...
Excuse me...
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Yes.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
No.
I got hung up!  Try this!
Shit...
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
I can't see them!
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
What's your air reading?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Unfortunately.  We can't.
What was it?
What music?  There ain't no music.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
The air's stopped.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
I'll think of something, don't worry.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Well what?
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Good, you can get this under control now.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Yes?
Jesus Christ!
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
All right, Kenny.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
Furry muff, let's go.
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
Is there no way they can get back to you?
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
How about you? All right?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
I mean it's fucking empty.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
And?
I can't help you, Plank.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
At what, exactly?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Get your fingers out of my soup!
How many wings have they got between them?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I can't take any more school.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Yes, sir--
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Because it's a job?
Yes, sir.
And you and Private Graves--
We were just dancing--
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
A .45--
He swore by it.  What?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You little pissant--
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in.
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
Same as they done in Mexico.
You know who I am?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Good.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Masons been around a long while.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Because I'm your father.
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Tipico.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
You go by your old house?
And Buddy was one of them.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
The Sheriff.
You told me one time it was true love.
How come you never got married again?
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
No. Is he sick?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
What about it?
You gonna stay out here?
I only went for my last two years.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
They've got my Amado.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
They've got me. Different thing.
Yeah?
Two years.
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
What's up?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
Me neither.
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
You heard right.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
You didn't marry him for love.
That's my business. Harry.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Some or it.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
And they all came...
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Hang on!
You can't.
Out!  Out!
--vanished.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Then what do you want?
Mine.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
I don't think the dead much care.
I like to know why things happen.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.
I won't say anything.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
How the fuck do you do that?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Oh yeah?
Is that all?
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Yes.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Can you do it?
Try.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
What is?
Fuck you.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Yes.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
I'm here for the week.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Hi, Charlie.
No way.
I see them every morning.
I don't know.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
I know.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
No one ever tells you that...
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Yeah, look at that thing.
I don't want to be.
A coke.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Yes?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Ok, well... I love you.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Good-night.
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want I send it to your room?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Do you think they have a room here?
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Thank God he did.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I don't know.  What are they?
What time did you make it for?
And how would you describe him?
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Just open the door, please.
Father, I'm right here.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Miette, come here and relax.
Kelson, hold on a second...
What's his name?
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
Yes, I know.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Yes.
What?
Sure.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
How're you doin' today?
Where is she now?
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
Child, take a bite.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
I don't remember that.
She's alright.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
I don't wanna see that.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
A horse?
How'd you get him to say yes?
Oh, great.
Too many times.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Thanks, Sidra.
I was just playing ball.
Didn't have to try very hard.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
I never knew a girl that could play.
He works at a bank.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I don't like flowers.
A ride home.
Please.
Would you watch the damn road?
So you took Shawnee, huh?
You do see me standing here, right?
My court, I go first.
She understands.
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
I never asked you to choose.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Cause I don't get it.
What?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
You hearing me?
Didn't we already have this conversation?
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
You came out early.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
What?
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
What's wrong?
Hello, Phil.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
I don't wanna talk to you.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Did you hear what I said?
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
About two years ago.
That's great, thank you.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Please, yes.
Yeah.
Yes I do.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
-- can I get you?
Where's Richard and Julia?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
Son, please, now....
DAD.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Sorry, little man.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
Finish it up without the lip.
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Do you have love in your heart?
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
You see?
I'm sick.
That's right.  That's the first time you're right.  I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
I paid you back.
Braces.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
You got it.
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
It's ok.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
Alright.  Thank you.
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
-- just to clarify --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
-- fuck you.
He passed away.
Not a problem.
...this close...
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
...uh-huh...
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Uh. huh.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
I don't know a loud crash.
And what about screaming?
I went out last night.
No.
You on any medication?
No.
All your other fluzzies?
Yeah. Yes.
I got in trouble at school.
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
-- did she talk to you?
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
I love you.
Bye.
Who?
hey.
How long with Ellen?
Do you have any children with anyone?
...No....
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
What's MOW?
No they don't --
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
Partridge?
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
yeah.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
I need this one.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Love you too.
I didn't know the answer --
I don't know.
Hi.
..sorry...
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
No, Louis!  No!
Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
I have it all worked out.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
Perhaps he serves a different king.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Why didn't you say so?
Who?
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Raoul is everything to me.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is its antidote?
What is that?
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Sire, I --
We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
You mean shut your ass down!
No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
You set to go -
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
I didn't hit shit!
Fine -
And who are you?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Well read this -
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
Seattle.
Figure you would have tried it already.
What exactly did you see?
What did you do then?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Where the hell is my car?
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
A bank?
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Nahhh...
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
What's the bottom line?
I have to.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
What else did you keep out of the papers?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
What's one way?
The mark? Yes.
What is it?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
Get me a plane...
When I'm done.
How do I know?!
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
He had to.
Stay in the trees.
It's happening again, Jack...
Let me stick this in the black hole.
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
The Tooth...
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
I'm very scared.
Yes.
Yeah. It's right here.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Cut the general crap.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
I have to see somebody.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
And... where are things?
Will?  You could come up here.
Yes. Is Molly there?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Yes. Who are you?
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
You went in the apartment?
No.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
May I keep the file?
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Pretty well.
Yes.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
What's up?
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Oh!
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Yes, your Holiness?
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Why isn't he MOVING??
Yes.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
They won't make it.
Right...
I don't know... My computer...
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
The Matrix isn't real!
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
For what?
And she knows what?  Everything?
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
You're the Oracle?
How did you know...?
How do you know that name?
What?
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
It's going into replication.
But an Oracle can.
That's different.
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
What?
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Where is it?
I'll be all right.
Hurry, Neo.
Thanks.
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
Salute!!!
How do you know?
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
No, she isn't.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Don't be smart.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
No you weren't.
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Teresa.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Do you have enough?
Anything specific?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
I know...I know.
Come on.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Yeah, it's your father's.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
Hi, Allison --
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
Am I not obligated to?
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
Did you just hear something?
Do you think I need a haircut?
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
I am now.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
For how long?  And why?
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
What you then?
Doctor lady make it irey.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Nothing?
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
How did you meet?
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
What do you mean 'free'?
I'm sorry.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
Yes!
Where are you going?
It gets worse.
But there's so much to tell you --
Hold me --
No.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
How long have I got?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Yes?
You've got a deal.
I guess so.
Yes, Bill.
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
It's all yours.
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
What's okay?
'Fish'?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Not at all.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
No.
I don't expect you to.
Get him in here.
You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
You fill the bill, Bill.
You should hope quite a while.
What?
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
I'm here.
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
You think Drew will go for it?
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
How did you know?
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Raise away.
It's something.
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Me?  Internal medicine.
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
Why not?
But we've got time.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
I have no memory.
What?
This isn't my room?
Hi, Leonard.
Don't say anything else.
I don't want blood on them.
I don't want your fucking money!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You told me.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Tell me about her again.
Sorry.
Don't remember.
What happened?
What does he want?
Why not?
Thanks.
My boyfriend told me about you.
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
It's good.
I enjoy it.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Who's she?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Why not?
No. You took them out.						  *
Why would I do that?						    *
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
Recruit us to do what?
It's a rip and a hit.
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
I got the item.
25% discount on the load.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Available cash is not an issue for us...
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Why?
Do I need it?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Of course.
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
Stevens?
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Nothing.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
No.
We're makin' moves on each other.
As in...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
And Jos, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
Switek?
Okay.  What's up?
Where's Riccardo?
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You sure you heard what I said?
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
You inviting shee-it.
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
Yeah.
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
Yeah.
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
You bet I do, sir.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Is he all right!
KNOCK IT OFF!
Ziat!
Yeah. How's Mom?
The Hilton.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
And?
Section 13?
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
I want to cut his throat.
I know where it is.
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Take a look.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
We?
That's it?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Anything you can tell me might help.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
No, what is it?
Then the roads are open...
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
I know how that can be.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
Well, I hope you like it.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DIDN'T...
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
So you've indicated. Do it.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
I don't know.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
What?
Have to wait.
I think you're right.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Three more chapters to go.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Just from his agent.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
I suppose I did.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
More like two-two point two million.
In any case we don't want your cash.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
..or hard wired..
Exactly where is she?
Right.
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
At least you walked.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Have you met them?
I've no doubt.
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No...
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Why did you phrase it like that?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Nyah still on the property?
Good job.  And thanks.
By asking me.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
What kind of show.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
Sleeping's better.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
You're sure about this?
Ethan?
Go secure.
Theyre dead.
Are you damaged?
Yes.
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
No sir.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
What kind?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
What about Job?
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyns on the move.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Ill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Try it again.
I always check the batteries.
Uh-huh
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
You haven't said anything.
What'd you do to your hair?
You're my father.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
I know that. I do what I want.
Where'd Johnny find you?
I don't know.
Just Johnny.
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Where are you taking me?
To the bed.
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
What did you do?
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
I think that's it.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
I was.
No.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Yeah, I'll be in.
I shouldn't.
Bobo, take the cart away.
On the floor?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Why not?
Where you been?
What! How do you know?
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Are you drunk?
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
It's late.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
Good.
I am alone in the world.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Are you sure?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'm a housewife.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Nerves.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Sure.
Yes.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
I'm too old for you.
Yes.
Marriage is happy news.
It's Cosmo's moon.
I don't know.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
I am your king!
You don't vote for kings.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
What, "is"?
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
OF course, my Liege ...
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
I warned you!
What?
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
And therefore?
What is your favorite colour?
I don't know that!
Here's one!
He hasn't got shit all over him.
And another!
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
But, Mother ...
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Listen, Alice ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
If we ... er ... 
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
What?
The Prince ... ?
Yes ...  make sure ...
You are in great peril.
You've come to rescue me?
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Shut up.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Sixty.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
She'll be worried about me.
She'll get over it.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
I hope to go up next year.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
She's busy.
The future King!
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Dare say you can be taught.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Yes, ma'am?
I was told you were in a fight.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
Then why send me back to them?!
Because I have to! 
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
The question is, do we need her?
Mrs Brown.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Yes.
Cold is good!
And now I am back.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
It's the game, ARCADE.
Turn if off!
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
It is.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Let's go around back.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Right, then...
Yeah, that's what worries me.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Never been on a snowboard.
Oh God...oh god...
But I don't understand...
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
Who fired everyone?
No.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
Whatever.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Wow!
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Good luck, honey!
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
But you won't.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"So... surprise"...
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Oh boy.
Could be unrelated.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Oh yeah.
Pick with expediency !
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
We drown.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Let's go.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
I don't help criminals.
Why ?
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
What ?
Yes, sir Mom. 
No.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Yes sir.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
Sir ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
I can see that but where ?
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
Thanks.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Nothing.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
I would do it again in a minute.
What about giving the other guy a break.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Her favorite poet.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
Thanks, I needed that.
Hi Dad.
Totally groovy huh?
We have a baby?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Oh.  Ohhh?
You mean, you knew about me?
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
I know that.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
I won't.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Vada.
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
What difference does it make?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
What if you don't wanna be found?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
And you'd be my cousin?
Good. I mean...
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
You're a good man Nicholas.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
They're great.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Okay.
Sounds like you're very organized.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Is that a yes?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Yes, I do.
Something wrong?
Sort of?
Oh, sure okay.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
He's so tiny.
You have no idea.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
You're such a baby.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Keep your voice down!
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Deceased.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
Okay.
No. Just, more activity.
It's only eight o'clock.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Soon honey, soon.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Yes.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Hi, is Vada home?
Oh, Vada...
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
We'd love to hear it.
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Can we look around in your camper?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Uh huh, why?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Yes.
It's my mother.
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
I am running faster!!
He likes her better than me.
It is not.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Umm, Ummmmm
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
... weeks.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
You've been working on this, huh?
The man you love.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I'm moving this book to Viking.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
Ju...
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
I need you.
W...
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
My very point.  Here's another one...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Till the gas ran out.
Michael!!
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
You've been the man in mine.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Oh, yeah.
Like family, huh?
To him.
... and you knew about this.
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Grand Old Opera --
I won first prize.
No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
I got them right here.
She's going to rest now.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
Oh, sure.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Have you talked to Triplette?
Third party?
He has that sign with the tree.
Barbara Jean.
To the bathroom.
Not yet.
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
Yes, sir. I need a room
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
I'm not really a musician.
A little. What do you need?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
How do you know if they do?
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
It just is.
Tom. You remember?
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
I'm not sure...
What?
What!
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Did it break?
What?
Oh --
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Sure thing.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Which do you recommend?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
You got something you want to do?
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Lobotomy Bay?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
By all means.
I see.
Ain't love grand.
Oh my God!  Sorry.
Yes, sir.
Not good.
Yes.
She sings? What does she sing?
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Where's it parked?
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Capt'n!
Where do the air ducts lead?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, no.
Wayne Gayle.
Two-thirty. Shhh...
How so?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
See Duff. He's the money man.
Hell, you got steady work.
Okay.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
Okay.
I don't know.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah? That's good.
Yeah. On the section gang.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
No.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Goin' to see my kid.
How about it?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
He could live with us.
Yeah, that's so.
You still didn't answer my question.
My kids want me to teach them.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
Go on - hit me!
What about your boy?
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
What d'you mean?
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
She don't look no worse to me.
I said, she's in great shape.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Guess it's never been easy.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
I'll be seeing you.
'Musta knocked her up.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Okay, boy, beat it.
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Don't play with me.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
What about McCoy?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
What?
Nobody has.
What?
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
I think you're full of shit.
No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
What's my end?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
Go ahead...
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Case...
So... did you get a look at heaven?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Who?
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Well, do you?
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Thanks.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Anita!
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
You've done five of my ideas.
Uhh, no.
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
You said that already.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
You're twenty-three years old!
And a gymnast!
I-
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
Thanks. So do you.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
What?
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We're very evolved.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Duh.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
We went through the door...
Yes.
I know.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Oh, please...
Ken!
You two got a thing going, or what?
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
Only the wet ones.
I know.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know.  Where are we going?
Ghostbusters are fearless.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
You okay?
Making friends?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Okay...thanks.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Those are ancient history.
Why is that?
Thanks, Max.
Thank you.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
But nightmares are the common thread?
Sorry.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
Doesn't matter.
I can do that.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Anything?
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
And what are they?
Listen.
Mary Helena.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
No.
Oh -- Okay.
Absolutely fine about it.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Right.
Okay.
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Excuse me?
You disappeared.
Nice surprise.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
... get fired.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Working with Leonardo.
Me?
I'll see what I can do.
Yes?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Hi...
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Just take my work for it.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
And yet you suspect her.
Why?
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
I was in luh-love with her.
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Thank you, ma'am...
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Right!
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Yes, ma'am?
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
Fuck Miss Ratched!
God Bless America.
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Ca-na-da...
Ca-na-da...
What? Where?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
What for?
Yeah, Mack?
Come here!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Shhh...
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
Just warmin' up.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Why not?
That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
Bye-bye.
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
He's not!
Hold it!
Oh, do you do much fishing?
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Poker!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
I don't, Doc...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
All I'm askin' is...
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
No, 'fraid not...
Oh, yeah?
Ten bucks.
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Yeah, what's up?
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Take you han's offa me!
Yes, Miss Ratched!
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Yes, ma'am...
Oh, yeah...
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
No.
You're sure...
What is it?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Hi there...
Hm.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
That was before I found out what it was.
Yes.
He's safe.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Who says I don't love him?...
Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Hi.
You too.
What are you doing here?
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
I know the feeling.
There's no such thing.
What?
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Yes.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
I brought you that, too.
And more...
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
How about the other one?  His friend.
How about that guy at the bank?
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
I know...  It was.
I have vacation time coming to me.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
What's that supposed to mean?...
What?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
I meant about my idea.
Men have ways.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
What?
You sure you'll be okay?
My God... you're right.
And he is living proof.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
I'd love to.
That's exactly what you are.
Went to high school with him. But...
That's all. Next witness!
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
It's a living.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Boss loader!
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
You training to be a nun or something?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
That was nice of you.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
In a saloon?
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
No thanks... .
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Don't say that, Edie, don't...
Told him what?
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
Edie...
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
About Edie?
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
But you still hold out for silence?
What do you think?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
What about it?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Raise a hand to me and... .
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
Aw, Johnny... .
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
Not that free.
Look who says bum!
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
...And I thought you loved me.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
Maybe so.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Then cancel my order.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Why not?
He'd call every once in a while.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
You're too late, Jack.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Sounds great.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
He knows where she lives?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Shit.
Uh-huh...
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
Shit.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
All right, but...
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
I could walk out of here.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Why you think is today?
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Nervous?
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
That's funny.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Of course I am.
Uh-huh.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
Yes.
That's my dad.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Don't leave me.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Or once.
You think I'd shoot you?
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I'm not leaving Midge.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
Meaning time came, I left.
That time?
There were others.
Glenn?
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
I'm freezing my ass off.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Me?
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
I can tell.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
I'd like that.
What'd I say?
No?
Not at all.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Ten gees.
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
That's me, Sir.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Sir, I --
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Power dive!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Yeah.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Six P-40's.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
Well...sure.
Then wh-where do we land?
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
We can explain, Colonel.
Bombers.
Sorry to trouble you.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Brilliant, Admiral.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
All of 'em.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
I'd take better care of my teeth.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
On what?
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eightysix.
Charlie...
And nothing will ever change that.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Refresh my memory.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
Why wait?
Great, isn't it?
You really love me, don't you?
Charlie, let's make love.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
How'd you know about that?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
What?
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Charlie? Was I dead?
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
I'm excused.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
What was?
Sort of.
I	know what a burrito is.
What's inside?
I don't know.
Sixtyforty.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
I'm not hungry.
All set.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Why not?
Yeah...
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
All the time.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
K-R-O-one.
I said, don't worry about it.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
You're going to the office?!
One hour!
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
That's not what I said.
Maybe you should think about it.
What's that mean?!
I'm not ready to die.
We're waiting...
He's upset, he's sorry.
Rayisha.
Arline?
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
We proceed, representing your estate.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
No. I didn't.
Yes. On my torso.
Yes.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
You're in trouble.
... we've got a committee meeting.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You're the asshole, buddy.
Lots.
Since when?
Probably since she was born.
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Night, honey.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Going on... like...?
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Saw something I didn't like.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Just give me your hand.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Like what?
Like my pistola.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
How many?
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
What the hell's it matter?
Just shut up, okay?
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
Frightening thought.
Riddick?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Say that again.
Well, you got the big gauge.
About the girl.
Just realized that, huh?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Nice embellishment.
So which one caught your eye?
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
So much for my cocktail hour.
Do you have any weapons?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Good luck then.
Neither do I.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
It's probably wrong --
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Sustained.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Huh?
To Earth! That we've landed!
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Come on. Get me out of here.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
My name is Taylor.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
God bless you.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
How the hell did he get away?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Then what do you suggest big shot?
I suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on ALL OF 'EM.
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
No!
No... I move faster alone. 
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Sounds like it.
You know what I'm talking about!
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
You don't know.

Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
What's the matter?
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
Would you mind?
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
No thank you.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
There's one less tonight.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Nice of him.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Anything I can do about it?
No use waiting, then.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Killaine...
There would be a moon tonight.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
Beer or ale, Miss?
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
I've never been to Florida.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
Points very straight to her.
Very ridiculous.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
I know that.
Sometimes.
Who's Goble?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What's a buzzer?
If I can get off.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
I don't.
Thanks.  I don't mind.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
I don't think you locked your door.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
With what motive?
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
Where's the shell?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Not quiet yet.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
I am a fool.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
I'm interested in who handled it.
How do you do, sir.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
But you still think she's innocent.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
What does it look like?
How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
No.  I'd want to--
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Did she talk about me?
Well, you should.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
Fuck off.
I'm waiting for your mother.
That's good.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
Oh no!
Promise?
'Night.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
De nada.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
You gotta tell me where she is.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
You never were...
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
I take the skin off chicken.
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
The shit they pull, huh?
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
You sure?!
Sure.
Catch of the day.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
Like the old days, Dillon.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
I saw it.
Thank you, Sergeant.
The best friend I ever had.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Hawkins?
I can't tell.
There's no sign of it.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Hope to be?
What?
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
You're not from L.A., huh?
For an hour.
Edward... you got it!
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Off the boulevard.
Fair enough.
Oooh, thank god.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yes...
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
"Occupational hazard".
Where'd you learn to do this?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
All right, two thousand.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
I think you'll approve.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Why not?
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Vivian...
Fuck off.
Shush.  Of course you can.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
You just did.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
It felt good.
The young lady staying in your room?
Thank you.
Cynthia's not coming?
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
But, Edward...
Do it.
Yes...
Goodbye, Bill.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I pray for that.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Do I!?  Momma!
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
What if they serve soup?
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
Of course.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
But how can you be sure?
I will never doubt again.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
What?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
I thought I was going faster.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Has it got any sports in it?
Because I can stop now if you want.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Yes.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Okay.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
It will not happen!
The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
Light him.
-- power too -- promise me that --
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
Begin!
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
Get used to disappointment.
Oh, have it your way.
Yes.
Good. Then pour the wine.
A little bit.
Your grandfather's here.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
What are you saying?
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
Ooooooops.
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
What do you mean?
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
What is it?
Good.  I will make the preparations.
But he has long hair!
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Nice girl.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
By the sacred memory...
Wagner...
Nietzche...
The Blue Max...
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
We won.
I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
What?
The following morning. Sunday.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
I don't believe it.  Do you?
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
Forty thousand dollars.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Just what he told your detective.
Sure...
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I ought to call the police right now!
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Arbogast said...
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Where could he have gone?
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
You're not.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I'm glad we didn't.
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
All right.
Sam, let's go get married.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Only my share.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
To a private island, like you?
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
That's it. 
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Then I'm free to go...?
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Leave me alone!
Mother, please...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Just before she died she came to--
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
I don't know--I can't tell--
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Go to sleep!
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
Yes!
Yes.
There's no child here.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
I'm not quarreling, only ...
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Thank you.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Ralph! Ralph!
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
You mean he was colored?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
We'll grant that.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Almost certain.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
It's all yours.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Here's a wow.
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
That's what they're going to ask you.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
Darned if I don't! 
How much money have you got?
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Is that a fact?
Fire insurance!
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Where to?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
And glow happily ever after.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Is Rose here?
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
What was your mother like?
Yeah, he's still up there.
And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Yeah.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
I think we both know her.
How goes it, darlin'?
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
No, sir.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Strange voices, Rose?
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
Yes, sir.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
You mean a farm?
Mine.
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
I had better call Daddy.
It'll get better now.
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Now you know what to watch for...
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
No you can't.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
Wha... ?
No, but it should.
I'm waiting till the time's right.
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
Nope.
Where have you been?
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
You know what I mean.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Can't be worse than you.
Out here.  On your knees.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
Keep 'em busy.
They're... around.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
Are you all right?
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Your father?
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Yes.
Oh. Well, yes.
On my mother's grave.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Janet.
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
Oh...
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Weiss.
Oh don't be so shy.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Yes.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Makes you cry
"Transylvania"
Now I
Like I'm outside in the rain
Free to try and find a game
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
You sure?
It's fine.
It's only temporary.
It's okay.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Could ya take off that hat.
...Yes --
...I can't beat him.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
That so.
Only a pig would say that!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
You're hurtin', man!
One more round.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Very high an' very fast.
Don't like yours neither.
Move your shoulders down.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No wine.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
I agree.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
...Fine.
No -- Just me.
Maybe I like garbage.
...What?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
More like thirty.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Ain't they?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
I got pain an' experience too.
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
Fine... That guy's great.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
See what?
Great, kid, great.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya always in a bad mood --
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Absolutely...
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
...Tight.
The story -- what's happenin'?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
So where is it then?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
R.K. Maroon.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
It's all yours.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Sounds like singin'.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Stop what?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
My brother.  Get inside.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
No, it's not.
Forget it.
I rest my case.
A challenge, on my life.
By my heel, I care not.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
At thy good heart's oppression.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Welcome.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
She'll not come down tonight.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Amen
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Nobody's saying they don't.
I didn't say I was.
Next.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Call it a reckoning of character.
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
My way is better.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Eat shit and die slowly...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
I do.
There is that.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Know what?
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I never made that claim.
You think?
No you don't, and you know it.
Just like that?
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Because I don't walk away.
Why not?
What?
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
I guess that's for the best.
You sure?
You put everything on the line because you...
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
I get the picture.
None of them had any --
I can't get enough of it.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Sure thing, and --
Oh, you would have done great.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Do you have everything?
We've got to go now, then.
Then Sally comes too.
He killed her...
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Hello.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
Nothing.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Thanks for your time.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Have you known this all along?
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Uh...C?
C?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Watch that.  Watch that tone.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Well you're not getting, either.
So I want the money and I want it now.
Is that the mail?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Well I don't know --
Give me the bad news.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
No, sir.
Two-hundred thousand!
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
No.  It's my first time.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
I knew you were lying.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
How you doin'?
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
This is a very dangerous man.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
You.
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
You said --
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
No.  It's not right.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What?
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
It doesn't matter.
Well we're not friends.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Are you serious?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Now that I believe.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
We have to get to the Penthouse.
This money is evidence.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
First class.
Fine with me.
Now you know.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Thank you.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Sir, I can explain.
That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
Carter.
No.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
What?
You don't know what a shortcut is?
No.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
You know War?
You know him?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
It's okay. For restaurants.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Carter, shut up!
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
What?!
Nobody touches me.
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Oh, please!
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Excellent.
You'll answer my questions?
Really?
A pre-wedding luau?
Really.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Done.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
You know, there's no...
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
I don't and I don't think you should...
Brian told you that?
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Yup!
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Ya think?
Why?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Not eight...
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
No.  It's my life.
Yeah.
That's good.
He's got a houseboat.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
I love you.
Even when you were young?
Does it have wheat in it?
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Okay, okay.
No.
It was my mother's.
I told you.  Nothing --
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Right.
I should say something in this about magic.
Is this crazy?
But he saw you, right?
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
How did it happen?
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Magic.  It was magic.
Sure you do --
The cabinets have to be redone --
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Why not?
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Do you want a fruit plate?
It's never happening again. Right?
What?!
P.  Dad?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
How do you know?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Is that what she used to sing?
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Good.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
Was Mom an adjustment?
Who is Annie?
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Okay.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
I read the same article...
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
They say I am no good to you.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Yes.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
You weren't waiting for me.
Hunting.
Sun up.
Ramn -- you can't.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
The what!
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
What attitude?
Shhh.
The spiders.
How about in the house?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Leave me out of this.
Go ahead.
It's not that easy.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
I can't.
You don't understand.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Because he'll kill me.
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
What happened to your eye?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Therapy session is over.
I been that way ever since.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Why's that?
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
Palmdale
He doesn't have one.
No. I'm good.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy.
Hey, check it out...
I can't tell you.
Okay! Okay!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
I was trying to score some dope.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
I thought you'd be happy.
What's he holding?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
He's the only one I told.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Really?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Tom, quit fucking around.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
...alright, let me know when.
Resistance?
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Shit, that was no big deal.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Hell, no!
Like hell, you did.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
Senator's son?
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
You know classical music?
Sure, you got one?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Beasley's dead.
I've got a line on one.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Oh, yeah?
You're welcome, John.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
You have orders, too.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Understanding the following rights...
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Excellent.
Okay, thanks.
I hope you understand.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Lloyd.
Yes.
I admit nothing.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
You should be.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
I know that.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
I'm so ashamed dad.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
No.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
That's cool then.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
You think so?
Come on.
Well... just meet her.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
We'll see.
Yeah, uh-huh.
We decided...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, no.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
No I didn't.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Then don't do it.
Oh shit.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Sir, the list is correct.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
Look it up.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I think it's too late.
Where?
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
No, it's me.
Can we talk?
I did that.
Did it?
Not until youre dead.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
Not one bit.
She dumped me.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
What are we looking for?
C'mon. Let's go.
Don't worry...
Whatever.
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Yeah, right.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
What's your favorite scary movie?
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
We got free tickets.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Good bye Ben.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Excuse me?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
How is that good news?
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
No.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Who is it?
But you know who she was.
Honestly, my life.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Good twist.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Duh... that's quick.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
I called my dad.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Are you alone in the house?
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
What number is this?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Nah, I don't think so...
Dial someone else, okay?
YES!
Please go away! Leave us alone!
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Yes, you doofus.
I don't know. I guess.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Not yet.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
What were you doing out here?
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
Do you still think he's innocent?
Many times.
And why is that?
Your front porch.
Hello Sidney.
No you didn't.
You got it.
You coming tonight?
There goes my chance with Sid.
Like you had one.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
It's all part of the game.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Oh, god...
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
One is gluttony.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Yeah, that's true.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
I realize that.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
Hello.
What about sports?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
Oh, that's all.
Bullshit.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Call an ambulance.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
Yes we do.  Here...
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Let's go.
How is this legal?
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
We had him.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
That part of me is dead.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
I will.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
How should I know?
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Now mount up, son...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Why?
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Cut it out, will ya...
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I got your boy killed.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
We got two around that age...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I mean the armchair!
Do you have a better idea?
Making our very own solstice fire.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Do I look like it that much?
1976.  What happened back then?
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Very funny.
The title won't do.
Writer, is he?
See you in jail.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Done.
Most interesting.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
On my mother's side the Ardens
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
But nothing is happening.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
What happened to Sam?
Every word.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
She is always Aphrodite.
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Who wrote that?
Romeo.
The one who came with your letter?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Ethel.
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
As a nurse.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Your Majesty
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
And I love poetry above all.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
I have lost my gift.
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
Oh--no, no!
There is time. It is still dark.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
I am going to church.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Do you understand me?
It is only ours you can know.
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
A theatre poet?
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Juliet?
So who's going to do it?
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Take his legs.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Can we talk about something?
I don't know.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
Your friends.
Except the money.
So I gathered.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
About the mail --
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
I don't know anything about it.
Cover it?
Are you recording it?
Parked outside?
That's all?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
You're right.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Did what?
I'm just looking.
Unfeasible.
Are you all right?
It tastes different.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
The perfect couple, I should say.
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
No.
It was on the television.
You and me?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Exactly what I was --
I'm boring?
What happened to that guy?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
No.
You know about it?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
No.
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
What?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
My keys.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Yeah, I think so.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And who's Jill?
... what?...
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
No thanks.
... yeah.
Gee, this is great.
I never get my hair done.
Yeah.
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
You are.
You are.
Yeah.
Right.
Wonderful woman.
Great.
Well, yeah... you know.
I guess not...
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
What's wrong?
Yeah... wow.
And?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
I don't want to... I swear...
-- this guy with Jill.
You don't do that anymore, do you?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
Mmmm --
-- yes, you --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Not me, pal.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
I don't know -- I've got to.
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
-- Oh yeah.
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Okay... thanks...
What're you talking about?
Here in the canyon.
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
Fine. How are you?
I am?
Yeah.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
How did it go at the bank?
Egypt!
George.
I want your feelings about it.
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
Who?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Well that's something.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
How many?
George, now cut this out.
What did you say?
You need a cut.
Well, yeah.
In a way. But...
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
Okay.
I know what you mean.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
... this doing hair it's...
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
Well, what?
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Didn't they tell you?
Have a drink.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Yes I do.
A daytime soap opera.
Sid.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
George is going to open a shop.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Because I don't want one.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Nothing.
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I would say so, yes.
That's right.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
I don't think so.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
Jill.
Do you have children?
You mean they ate each other up?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Yes, Dad.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Is there something bad here?
What about Room 237?
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Danny!
Is Tony one of your animals?
And, er... where are they now?
Who?
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
What line of work are you in now?
Your money's no good here.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Yes.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
I think he did it to himself.
Yes.
Wendy give me the bat.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
can of itself be a problem.
I'm intrigued.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Royalty?
Blue. This blue.
Where's Mom?
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
I don't get you.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
I will- be good, kids.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Really?
What about crack?  You a user?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
SING!
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You can handle this.
Thanks.  A lot.
This prom is a real drag.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Why?
That man -- who is he?
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
What?
A bunch of real mama's girls.
A novice.
Excuse me?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Experience!  Right?
Mary Clarence!
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
The reason?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Check your driver's license.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
A what?
No food.  Not until sundown.
And whom would you call?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Mary Clarence!
In English?
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
What do you mean?
The majority has spoken.
You have a phone call.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
Don't push it.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Pray. 
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Like what?
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
Even nuns have to pee.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
We didn't tell you what?
It didn't work, Vince.
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Measles.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
May we look at them now?
Well... that might be... helpful.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Well... so much for common sense.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
Up.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Lady Van Tassel.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
You are funny.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
You made this, and the drawings?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
They have done nothing of the sort.
It was not butchery.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
His horse.
Very little.  I must be going...
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
Good to know you, Karl.
How are you, Bill?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
About a half a mile I think it is.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah.
Catch you later Freddy!
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
Please Doyle, don't.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
I'll be back in a little bit then.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
Why? Hi, Karl.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
Two people.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
It was fun, anyhow.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Okay.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
You better go get 'em.
I want to come back and stay here.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
My history.
Tolerable, I reckon.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
I done et just a little bit ago.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Better make it charge. 
Huh?
What's the difference?
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
It's kind of overwhelming.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
How old, kid?
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
You got it.
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
It means "happiness."
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Sure thing. See you later.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
I thought maybe he was pretending.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I think I'll take them. 
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
Thanks for the tip.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
And his parents?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well what?
What do you want me to say?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Huh?
So what's the time?
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
I owe you something.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Yeah, that's right.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
Is your father an artist?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
How long have you been here?
Two or three nights.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
I don't have much time. 
Let's not get too idealistic.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Now ask him who his mother was.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
Yes, please.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
A thousand.
Is that your third question?
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
Pretty darn clear.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
Yes, he was.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
It's private.  Go away.
Hey, she's ticklish!
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
With me?
That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
You'd better go fix it.
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Get me Room 414.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
I'll say.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
We better have a drink first.
I'm just going to get some ice.
Thank you, Daphne.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
I'm a what?
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
Yes.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
We could dye our hair.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
About that roadhouse -
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
You're making it up pretty good so far.
It's three weeks in Florida -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I'll say.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Yeah.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
My fault.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
- riding to hounds -
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
Harmless - how?
What thing?
You mean - like frigid?
What happened?
What else is there for me? 
What is it?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Mineral baths - now really!
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Did you have a nice time?
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
No, thats not it.
Oh, hello.
Maybe not her least... Theres always--
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
So, whats your point?
Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Brilliant.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Kat.
Both.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
What does your gut say?
A weekend?
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
What?!
When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Spontaneously combust?
What?! No, no. You cant--
You have more than one gynecologist?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Ahoy!
Hard.
Is he here in Borderdale?
That's where we come from first?
Sure--
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
Yes mam...
Go on...
Yes mam...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Hi, Daddy...
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Where did it come from, Mama?
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
Yes, mam...
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
I wanta get some things.
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Montana.
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
Okay.
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
No way.
No you can't Kenny!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
Eric?
Something big, children.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
What's the password?
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Yeah!
Totally!
Me?!
Are you sure, Kenny?
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Yes?
What the hell is going on?!
Oh God... What have I done...
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
I sure did, Phillip!!
Cheers, Terrance!
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
Yup.
<u>WHAT?!</u>
Hi Stan.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Excuse me?
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
What is the condition of the bridge?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
That's clear.
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I don't know.
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
So we did.
Sure.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
What?  What are you talking about?
I can't!
Barnes?
So what's going to happen to you?
Marry you?
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Talk to him...Jesus...
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
The engines!
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Can I get you something for the road?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
It belonged to my dad.
He's my dad.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Putt-putt golf?
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
What's it look like to you?
Don't say that about my mom!
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Who's there?
What did you do to Buzz?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
What does he do?
No. Not at the present.
We'll get into that later.
Nothing.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
You're here.
Zip.
Why not?
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
We would have sooner or later.
You should.
At least I'll die smiling.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
That's our reserve air.
Now!
What team?
Anything else?
Press?  No, I haven't.
They didn't tell me anything.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I don't know.  That's the point.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
When was this?
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
In the ship, sir.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
She's not gonna know.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Underwater?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
It never occurred to me.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
What -- are you threatening me?
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
And you didn't tell anyone?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry?
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
We must've had it delivered then.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
But why is he doing it?
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
How do you spell it?
Causes sleep.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
How long does it last?
Doesn't say.
For what?
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You're insane.
Yes.
It's not safe for you to be either.
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
Get away from me!
How's that?
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's an American spacecraft.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
In time for what?
Like what?  I'm not --
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
What?
Don't be defensive.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
What are they?
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What happened to her?
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
I don't think so.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
You mean forget?
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Please.  It must have flown here --
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Like what?
The creature?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Who's going to pay me then?
Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
You saw through me?
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What do I do?
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
What's that?
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Why?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Come back here... Where are you going?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
What an honor...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
We're the old men, Ace.
Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Your father will never let you.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
I got Games & Theory.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
They revoke our flight status.
Well, whad'ya know...
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
So ?
You're upset, that's alright.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Shhh...
Did you get Starside R&D ?
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
You're the best.
Flip six, three hole.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
What's that, Diz ?
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
You used to dance...
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Aw, don't get mushy.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Yes, sir...
Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<U>Why</U>?!
'To learn all that is learnable.'
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Ten seconds....
Hold station.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Viewer ahead, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
I'll be there.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
I need a typewritter.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
What's it called?
I beg your pardon?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
But why the dalmation?
It was either that, or a sardine.
Yes.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
I live there.
...that.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
...lost the screw...
Never saw the point of 'em.
Because I'd met someone else.
...what...?
You know what else a man can do?
Well ain't you amazing.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Go you Huskies...
Ten thousand dollars.
I beg your pardon?
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
I will.
Sure, what have you got?
How old are you?
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
No, you're absolutely r...
Of course he...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Mr. Bailey.
Thank you.
I wasn't in the car.
We know that you weren't.
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look there's someone else...
That's my...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Who are these from?
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
You said <u>three</u>...?
Doug, the traffic light...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
This young woman.
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Yes.
Who's White...?
You bet he did.
It burnt down.
I can only write on a manual.
I grew up on your mov...
I hurt my finger.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I...
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
No.
What did you say to them...?
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
There's no witnesses...
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
I want them thrown in jail.
Sherry, Sherry...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Ain't no second chances in life.
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
Great.
I'm not.
This is my daddy's house --
That's so weak.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
Great.  Big ears, too?
Then have a donut --
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
Is that like Luigi's?
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
And we all went through that together?
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Look, I...
I need practice.
Fine, forget it.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
She was angry at herself.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
You're a cross-dresser.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
Feeling the pressure?
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
It's no biggie.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Oh.
He was in a concentration camp?
Thank you.
Really? How many?
My grandchild-baby.
He's dead.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
We're not ready.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
What's an audience going to tell you?
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Come here, give me a hug!
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Toby Oxman.
But...you called.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Eight, six, and four.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
What do you mean?
How much do they have?
Good.
Agreed--let's move it.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
General Schmuck?
You aren't sure!
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
That's right, Major.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
Ask away, Major.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Do you think they would cheat?
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
General, stick to the point, please.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Very interesting.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Seond safety.
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
I said that's the point!
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Let me check.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yeah, when's he coming?
It's really not about anything.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
And your mom.
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Ah!
No. Life is too short.
Uh, last night...
No, no.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
You know?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
No. It didn't, Buff.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
No.
Great.
Shit.
Alright, Pony!
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Glad it's okay.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
No, no, whoa!
Yeah.
Yes!
Yeah!
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
No, not really. Middle-class.
He is.
Mm.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Erica.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Well, w-what happened?
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Oh, shit.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Is that Bee-Bee?
Look, why do you care, huh?
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Name one.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
So what do you wanna do?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
No, no.
Mm.
You do.
No, I don't.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Good, man.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Yeah, I crash there.
Of course it does.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Get off my property!
No, this has everything to do with you.
It's stupid.
So? What's L.A. like?
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah.
I can't believe you're still here.
Yep.
That's because I am.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Oh, my god!
I think I gotta go.
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Whatever.
Your manager?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Jeff!
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
No car.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
No...I've been pregnant.
Positive.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Oh, Jack...
Trix...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
Don't use big bills!
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
All of you!
More proof God's a guy...
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
Hi, Artie.
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
How about the Rainbow Room?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Well....
Are you hungry?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
You did?
He thinks it could be made into something.
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
I just don't.
What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I wrote that with my heart.
It's getting kind of late --
There sure is.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
I've lost my car.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Come on!
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Where are your...?
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
You think I made that up about the gun...
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
No, they don't.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Wipe your feet!
For me?  Okay.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
The doctor suggested it.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
That's right.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Thank you, Max.
Softball.
But which one?
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Yes.
How do I fight it?
Hmmm?
I'll mention it upstairs.
I bet they do.
I'll drink to that.
What an adorable hat.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Supergirl?
I've got things to do.
Nice to meet you.
Theories?
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
You bet your ass.
Can you create life?
It was just a trim.
It doesn't seem right.
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
He's nice.
No, MR. Danvers.
What? Me?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
I have to talk to you.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I know.
But it's impossible.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Brad Wilson.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him --
It sure is.
Oh...I came close once.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Me neither...
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Call me.
Well, aren't you excited?
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
At one o'clock in the morning?
What are you doing?
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Who gets it, the company?
Say what?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Fair's fair.
Everything.
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Sister! I'm his sister!
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
I didn't have my camera with me.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Diet soda?
In other words, push this red button.
What's wrong?
We can get to work on that oil!
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Maybe I could try --
Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
We'd better talk.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Does Lois know about this yet?
What else is ballast for?
You'll have to pack quickly.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Genius!  --  Lex.
It's beautiful.
Sensible enough.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I asked the right question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
What do you want?
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
Stay. I will come to you.
Sentimental idiot.
That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
Don't worry, I've got you.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
I'm not so sure you do.
Politely?
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Something . . . wonderful.
Our other dinner guest.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
What do you fear?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Lois isn't here?
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
I know.
I know son, I know...
Not really, no.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Unbelievable.
Huh?
Oh.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
It wasn't a trick!
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're just jealous.
You're not the only one.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
What are you doing here?
Screaming
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Tough guy, huh?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I'm going to bed.
Bingo!
What do you suggest, my dear?
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
There was a recipe on the back  --
I knew you'd hit me.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
Right on the first guess.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
Sure.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
But...why?
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Are you still in touch?
But you said...
It turns to steaming piss.
That's okay.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Billy, please.  The children.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Billy, that's too early.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
For rabbits?
Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
That would complicate things.
Excuse me?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
No.  A little sugar though.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
It's interesting.
Should I keep reading?
Okay.
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
Yes.
Yes.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Positive.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Don't even try to remember.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Okay.
There's talk of that.
Yeah, right.
The Ottos.
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
Is it news to you?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Why?
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
She knows now.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
Can you be there by two-thirty?
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
I hate to see you like this --
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Take a top coat.
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
If you want me to -
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
Yes, but why?
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
My mission is to protect you.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
You told me to.
Cool.
Chill out, dickwad.
She intends to change the future somehow.
Drive faster.
Yes.  Throw it in.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Go!  I'll finish here.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Why him?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
And Skynet fights back.
Why attack Russia?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
No.  There is another chip.
And no elbows on the table!
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
Yeah.
No can do.
Three months.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
Of course.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
It's the truth.
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
No!
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Do you know what's in this archive?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
Absolutely not.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Come to the office, please.
Don't wear the beige one.
Aha!  Is she young?
Come here.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
That's the way it was told to me.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Not possible.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
No.  Never.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
Why?
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I just called.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Where are you going?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
Yes... well...
I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Keep it.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
God, wake up, it's a con!
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
I didn't say anything.
I'm back from the dead.
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
You call them...
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
We searched the house.
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Julliard, yeah.
Underwear?
Happy Birthday, man.
No.
Why would you say that?
Do it for YOU.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Of course, Nick...
What is?
No, thank you.
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
What kind of vacation?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
It's all down to this...
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
Don't take another step.
The key?
Goodnight.  Where was she?
What's this about?
The Hinchberger wedding.
What?
You know you can.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Sure.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
All right...
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
She was unhappy.
Why?
Mrs. Dudley.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
That depends.
Yes.  I've missed it.
No, it's getting worse.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Well?
Just had to be sure.
Not for you, clearly.
Am I a thing?
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
Come over here.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
This is un-fucking professional.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Our black friends?
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
You're home, then.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
One thing I need.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Probably.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Hard to miss.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
How d'you mean?
Try calling me again.
Weren't you on a television series?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
Footloose and fancy free.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
My employer.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
I'll bloody well ask him.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
Bloke told me.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
So what's your beef, pal?
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Sounds like you need a rest.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
There is?
How we gonna get that lucky?
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
No trouble.
You know I don't live with him.
Who's looking for you?
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Yes, Ann?
Oh, Mr Crane--
Uh-huh.
Ah.
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
Huh.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I'll have it in a week.
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
Right! Strictly business.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
How's business, Dave?
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
...You know... who *who* is?
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
Come on in.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
I didn't say a word.
Congratulations, Gina.
Honey...
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
Oh, hell. Drink?
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Yeah.
Whuddya mean?
OK.
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
Hello, Walter.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Anything missin'?
I'll go down and speak to him.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
I don't want to scare people.
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
Where's the walk-in safe?
What's the combination?
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Correct.
I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
May I see that?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Let me see the plant press.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
What is it?
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Keep the animal quiet.
What's that?
Okay.
How does it work?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What happened?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
Then it won't go after the others?
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
It's coming.  Run.
I have to shoot.
One.
<i>A month.</i>
Why wouldn't I?
You want to book the flight?
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
That and a fat, new contract.
It has to be the reality.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
I'm the creator.
Shhh!
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Saturday?
I think I've studied enough.
Yeah?  Outta what?
So when are you leaving?
Trust me.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
This is where it started.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
What do I do?
--we need more charcoal.
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
You hate gambling.
I think I'd like a little company.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Were you there--how do you know?
I don't understand.
I'd ask for identification.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Working with?
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
No. Don't bother.
You a reporter?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
He just let it explode.
That's what I'm saying.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
What killed those men?
I'm not sure. A virus --
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
Did you find something?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
What happened to playing a hunch?
Where are you, Mulder?
All I told them was the truth.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
No.
I was until about an hour ago.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
I don't know, Mulder.
For the purpose of what?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
Thank you.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
Is she alive?
How?
No.  No.
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
I did, yeah.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
He's beautiful...
Initiating connection.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
I doubt that.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Sit down.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
Were you at the inquest?
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Tell me more.
I thought you wanted...
Yes.
What are you going to do?
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Why?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
It wasn't important.
Two weeks ago.
It's true then?
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
I'm not asking you to.
This is where he vanished.
No.
Fifty yards right down there.
Win what?
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Yes.
Zwei zwartze.
At the end of every chapter --
Will you give me...
But you will.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Thank you.
English?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
You don't mean that doctor?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
I am not a bad man.
He didn't want to get involved.
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
Joseph Harbin.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Okay.
Richard. Hi.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Yes.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
Fuck off.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
Swim?
So?
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
Who the fuck are you?
Yes.
Let's look at the fucking thing.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
That's stupid. Why would they?
Oh, yeah... 
What assholes.
What's it about?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
What'd you say?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
What's that?  Okay. Surprise us...
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Get the fuck away from me.
It was a nine millimeter.
I can't say that.
Daniel Balint.
So what Jew would you kill first?
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
Steve...
I've got to get back to the --
Number ten.
You could do it.
What...?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
So what do we do with the device?
Why me?
I can tell....
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Funny?
What?
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
Italian is practically the same thing.
You know each other?
In a lake.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Enzo!
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Because you'd laugh.
How do you know that?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
Lira?
Six seconds.
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
... What's your name again?
Noireuter.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
... And his friend, Johana...
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
No... in the hut.
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
It's too loud for me.
Uh... Yes, of course!
It's me again.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
You called the police?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
No.  I'm just depressed.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
What's up?
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mazel Tov!
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
Why not?
That depends. How much money has he?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
You really think so, Charlie?
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Where? Where did you find it?
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
What are you doing that for?
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
At four. He will be there at four.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Why?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard   Don't you?
It's better you don't know.
Thanks.
I thought they came right past here 
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
You're too good to me.
That's easy. Me.
Clo-Clo?
I know. Funerals.
Yes.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
You a tourist?
Will you please come with me?
That depends what youre looking at.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Paul Lamont...?
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Should I?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Then find another way.
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
So, what are you looking for?
What kids?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
How are you, Jane?
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
La what?
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Okay. Recommended...
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
We conclude our transaction.
Is my money in there?
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Three oclock.
Im sorry...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
He just said he had good reasons.
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
I know his work better than I know him.
What about which girlfriend?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
Viens.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
What sums?
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?
That's a good idea, sire.
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Now?
Better today than tomorrow.
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
So... what am I supposed to do now?
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
To be killed in battle?
Not yet!
I want to stay with you...
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Quite a few.
Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Praying.
Yes...
Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
You really think she's been sent... by God?
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Noooo!
Yes.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
God.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Yes.  We can pray.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
Reinforcements?  Where??
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
It's not possible...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Playing...
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
Who?
Oh no?  How about this one?
In His name??
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Who is this "he"?
What... does he... look like?
Why did she have to die?
Jeanne, be patient.
I want to be with him always...
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
Dead.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
I'll be fine.
Here.
What, I'm working, what?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Tough luck.
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
God forbid!
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
Watch his hand
To be deaf?
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Yes
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
No.
What happened?
On your piano, that is the swap.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
What will I play?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
No, no cops!
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Here.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
Don't worry about it, pal.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
If that's the way you want it.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We'll be waitin'.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Mottola.
They're still looking for him.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
All he's gotta do is read.
I can talk, can't I?
I'll take him anyway.
Neither are we.
Yeh, it was easy.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
The wire is ten years outa date.
That's why he won't know it.
That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
See and raise five.
Raise 5,000.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Yeh, sleepin'.
I feel lucky tonight.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
You got a system, Carver?
It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Come on, gimme a break.
You know how they are... sex...
Do you suppose.....  ?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
You've got to get your mind off this.
And don't ever try to see me again.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
tried him once -
I don't know.
Which way did she fall?
What would your mother say to that?
This is my wedding.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Who's is it?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Who're you calling?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
No.
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Why yes.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I said all right!
Why, you said...
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
No.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
This is your party.
Who is she?
What are you drinking?
Yes.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Yeah.
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Maybe I will.
Why don't you?
Catch me letting you go alone!
Goodbye, darling.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
What do you mean?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Couple of months anyway.
Smart gal.
Why not?
It's the only way it makes sense.
He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
What's in the other direction?
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
Break it out.
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
Then get up and do something about it.
He...he could have been watching us.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know he isn't.
Get out of my way.
What if I do?
What about Jaeger?
No you're not.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
It's the only way.  We drive!
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
Just relax.
Shut up and listen!
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
What?
He's not going to leave us.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
Wes is dead!
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
Just let me rest for a second.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Then I'm a rich man.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I could use some recon photos too.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Yes!
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
You have to go with us, Wes.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
All last night he could have been--
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
What's the matter with you?
No one can see us now we're alone.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
THX and me.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
I'll report you.  It's....
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
Maternity ward, huhh!
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
No?
And you are...?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Now wait just a fucking-
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Yep.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
What's wrong?
It's from an IRA.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Shit. We're fucked.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Nice suit.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
I want to see-- 
You can trust me.
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
Otherwise I'll call the police
I know it!
M'sieu Monescu!
I would like to.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
Right.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
We'll take the Royal Suite!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
Correct. Now the train leaves--
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
By the way, how is your German?
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I know that niche.
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Together.
You're conceited--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Then why do you want to go?
On the night table.
Instantly.
Giron...!
To M'sieu Laval?
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Didn't you take it with you?
Well, where is it?
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
You're certain?
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
I'm tryin' boss.
A hundred and one next month.
Don't drop it Rose.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Good. Settled then.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
You're crazy.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
I've got you. I won't let go.
I see you.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
He does landscapes.
He couldn't have.
I'll wait here.
It's so cold.
I can't feel my body.
Just tell us what you can --
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
This is Miss Marsh.
I can explain--
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Baloney!
We'll save you a place at our table.
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
What did you want a gun for?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Good-by!
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Well, I can't.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
You said it! How about a little action?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
We coulda got two third-class!
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
No, sir?
My change.
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
O.K. Heads you win.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
How?
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Yes--Me--in person!
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Miss Marsh.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Like it?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Do what--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Let me look at it.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
No...
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
You retired, too?
Ecentus stultorum magister.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
Say when.
Enough?  Never.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
I'll remember you said that.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
But Doc-
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Awful lot of money.
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
Fun though, wasn't it?
I laugh sometimes
Doesn't suit you.
I hate Sadie.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
That what you got me up here for?
Forget it, Ringo.
Not anymore, not after this.
Drop his horse.
So he can tell the story.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Yeah, and dangerous.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Admiral, are you suggesting -
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
I appreciate your time -
- We all want what we can't have?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
They point, I shoot.
Three. You? Married?
No?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
He was my father's best friend!
You are seriously deranged.
Trust me.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
I understand.
Sabotage?
Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
...I see.
Fueled and waiting.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Abort the cruise.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
How old are you?
You were in hell?
Babe Brother.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You're always taking his side.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
It's healing now.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
I'll be right there.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
What's a toby?
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
When did you talk to Harry?
You know the man next door is near death.
Okay.
Just one?
No, I haven't seen him.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Shield your eyes!
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
The match!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
I can't see a thing!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
No she's NOT --
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
A lunchbox...?!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
I thought he was at summer camp!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
What?!
Slink!  Hang on!
But you're Irish!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
You're only a young thing.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
It was only a mouthful!
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Victoria -
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
He's not here.
What is he being charged with?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
So my wife is lying?
Goodbye Arnie.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
I'm third in my class.
Then here's a little bump.
Why?  Nobody's there.
Nope.
She ain't in on it.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
We're playing!
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
So you pay off our customs officials?
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
Your new friends.
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What is it you want me to do?
It could mean that, yes.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
No. On you go.
I'm sorry.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Did you bring the cards?
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
So why have you told me about it?
What? Steady like?
Sixteen next month.
What happened?
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
No.
Cheers.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
It was my fucking television.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
The Sick Boy method.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Such as?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Have the Klingons responded?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Why?
Fascinating.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
How do you know?
Is what possible?
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
Fire the rockets!
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I don't control minds. I free them.
No. I refuse.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
No conditions.

  

Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
You know I'm right.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Want one?
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
To warn him.
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Not a chance.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
You wouldn't dare.
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Well, isn't it -- ?
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
Yeah, I... oops!
Wrote the...?
Let's get some power here.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Tron...?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Come here.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
How?
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Okay, Dad.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Here, check these out.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
In her dreams.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
The purse is still at the house.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
I wasn't cheating!
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Uh, yes, it is important.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
They said you had to run out.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
No.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
No.  Doris.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Harry... snap out of it!
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
What about the husbands?
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Yes.  Go ahead.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Yes.  Now go.
Helen.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
How?
Wait a minute -
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
How come?
Don't eat anything.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
And here we are.
What time is it?
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
What do you do?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
Five.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
So he really loved her?
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
My pimp.
You will?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
Heard that.
You wanna get unhaunted?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Every word of it.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Let me handle this.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
He trusts you?
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
I believe he believes him.
You're no longer an extra -
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
He knows something's up.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
That's bullshit.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
You're right. It is.
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
Shut up!
What are you going to do with us?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
And your only goal is...???
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
A jail?  Prison?
No more drugs.  Please...
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
James, why don't we...?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
See -- you can drive after all!
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
You're sure?
I thought I was in...prison again.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
I...I...We need cash, James.
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Flowers!  What flowers?
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
I'm not crazy.
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
You can't do that yourself?
I said I was sorry.
That's 'cause he's dead.
Nothing.
That's my morning's pay.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
How much time?
Twenty-after-ten.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
How much!?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Yeah, you better remember that.
Let me have a Beck's.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
Uh-huh
Jake.  No.  No!
That's right on my way.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
Accident.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Where you headed?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Where'd you learn to do that?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You love him?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Funny thing.
Not me.  Us.
Give him the money.
What?
He was going to--
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
But I want to say with you,
What for?
No.  I swear it.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
Accident.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
About things.  About your wife.
That's a bit much.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Trouble with the car again?
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
She's dead.
You're too quick for me.
How old are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Nope.  No problems up the road.
No!
No police!
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
What?
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
I'm not rambling.
You meant it.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
Yeah, I can fix it.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
You've been there?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
I like that about me, beautiful.
May I carry your package, Grace?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Where you headed?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
A medicine man?
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
You know what I want.
Did you ever?
Walk away.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
No! You get it!
I'm not coming back.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
I'm not sailing his boat.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Out of here.
I don't care, just get me there.
Sure, I'll try.
What was that all about?
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Oh?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Like you helped her, Jake?
I have a lock on the door.
I know.
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
No that's it.
Yes. Is this David?
Yes.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
Seventy-five percent.
What was your idea Elijah?
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
We've already begun.
But not a knife?
Like what?
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
No Jeremy.
Get mom.
I see.
Jeremy listen to what--
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
No.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Thank God.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Ah, I see.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
Nope.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Yeah, I guess.
Shit and fried eggs.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Oh.
Be careful with those, sonny.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Yup.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
But... if he doesn't miss?
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
N-no, sir?
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
What for?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
Huh?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
What happened, did you hit him?
Yeah, he's in there.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
You better get on back, Miss.
Yeah.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
I seen him.
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Maybe.
That ain't what I mean.
An' if I spot 'em?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
And ?
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They just said they wanted time.
Edie, please.
Umm ...
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
This whole thing was a shakedown.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
Did you hear what he just said?
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Not if we do it my way.
We'll make it.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
We want to meet him.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
Right.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
I never heard of him.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
I knew him. He would never -
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.  It would be.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
I know of him.
...of Anesthesiology?
I am seventy-four years old.
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
You may step down.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
I completely understand ...
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
The Doctors were not negligent.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Thank you.
... and you're going to do that?
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
The most respected ...
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
I was held up.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...things change.
I had a witness disappear on me.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
I can't guarantee that...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Yes.  Price...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Is this a bad time.
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
No...no...
No.
I'm going to help her.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
No.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
I don't know.
Mrs...
Yes.
One hour.
Yes.
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Yes.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
How long have you been back?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
No.
Where'd she go?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
She is not my wife.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Why?
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Ah, no!
Ernie's?
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Madeleine died here.
I need you.
We're going up the tower.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Where were you?
Where had you been before?
No.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
I don't like them.
Knowing I have to die...
And no birds sing.
No, thank you.
Madeleine!
No, don't ask me!
Vaguely...
How do you know?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
It's all there. It's no dream.
No... we're together...
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Carlotta Valdes?
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
What car?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What's tomorrow?
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Who?
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
I don't know why the floor was wet!
What did you say?
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
Eat my ass!
Go home!
You go home!
What?
Calling the ambulance.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Just stop.
Sure, why not.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
So I didn't fucking do it!
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
We can't do this.
That is absolutely not true.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
They're singing.
I won't do it.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
Where's the bathroom?
What does that mean?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
That's right.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Not tonight.
What is her disposition?
No.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
What is the question you asked me?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Say it again.
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Hear what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
I'm serious.
You hate women.
Not true.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
What?
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
You said nobody would miss her.
You will not screw this up.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Photographer?
How could I know what else I forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
What?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Right before the wedding?
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
It's vile!
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Not padded ones.
Do you love me?
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Call the police.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
But...
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
It means she's insecure.
About what?
I just want her to be happy.
How do you know she's dead.
I have no idea.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
Greenpeace?
Pup corn?
Drum banging real times.
That's right.
Two.
That one.
You have no feelings toward ...
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Don't you ever see him?
No, but what a pity life is like that.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
He was asking for it.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Where?
I'm afraid.
But, miss ...
All right, Mother.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
Mother.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
I've had a gutful of this.
I have a headache.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Catch him and your record's clean.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
I wish we could hear them.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
I've seen worse.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
On my life, I promise you I will.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
Do I get to see it or not?
This is supposed to be years away.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
All my work is my finest.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
That's not true, Parker.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
What happened when he was 17?
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
As a matter of fact, it is.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
How did you get your hand out?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Stop me.
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
That, or living through him...
Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
Lindenmeyer?
Duck!
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
What'd ya think?
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
What rig?
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
What would do that...?
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...they sound what?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
...uh huh...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Quite touching.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
Where's my pill...?
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
We're locked into Albania.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
...Good...
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
...uh ... No, that's...
...going to War...
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
"The Country Is At War." 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
They got to have something that we want.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
How's our friend?
Why not?
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
Fine.  Good.
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...
The hats.
Why a beret?
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Show some compassion.
a "pond," or
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
All right, I owe you one Marv.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
...Work okay?
The FAA announcement.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Okay.
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
You're learning, sport...
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Break it.
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
Oh Christ!
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
Businessman?
About what?  About us.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Ok toots, I will.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Thank you
Allow me sir
No Jonathan.
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Vell.  Goodnight.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Safety in numbers man.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
I'll come back all the time.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
A ghost?
Then why did you?
Well, that's what we're here for.
Your friend saw them.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
You were in an accident?
Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I've seen you.  From the window.
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
You must have been very proud.
This is...
Oh God...
Do we have to?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
The planchette?
Shhh.
M-E...
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
All of us.
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
It's okay if you're not.
Not the focus.
I'll be there.
Remember how we were?
To make sure she's all right.
Mmnph.
That's...
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Shhhh.
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
No.  Look!  In the window.
I didn't do that.
When?
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
This is the Feur thing?
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
But then you've been so much better...
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
I will NOT.
We walked all night...
...Please stop...
Since when?
STOP IT!
So you fucked a student?!
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
Get out of my way.
She can't be here without me.
How can you be sure?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Don't think so.
Shhhh.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
What are you talk---
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I under5tand.  All the same
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Eighty million doll --- ?
ENOUGH!!!
The door, Michael.  find the key...
You bastard...
To love, you must be able to feel.
Do not tell me that!
But have I...?  Ever...?!
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Hello..
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Their what...?
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
BRIAN...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I don't know
I don't know...
You've killed but you're not a killer
Why not? Please - it would help me
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
No - I'll have you after
At 2.00...
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm your landlady
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
Get out...
Don't worry about it -
I'll be sure to...
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
God, I love being dead.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have changed since second grade.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We love our lives just the way they are.
It's my private business! Mine!
You're way ahead of me again?
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
It's okay. You need me?
They're in the ignition, silly.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
So, what brings you here at his hour?
I don't get the distinction.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Whatever.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Come on.
You're quick. I like that.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Me? The King of Coitus?
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
About Suzie?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
You have someplace to be?
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
No.
Just tell us what happened.
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
I'm sorry?
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Nothing.
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Yes.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
That's not your line.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
Will they?
Story's the same, Detective...
Yes.
That's right.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
Hi, Sandy.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Didn't you see her this morning?
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Almost?
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
What way is that?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Yes, me!
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
The first.
It is?
Is this what's left of your army?
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
Me!
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Just do it!
I don't know much about him.
Who??
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
The sorceress.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Oh sure, Fred.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Who else knows?
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
You couldn't wait until morning?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Hochmut?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
Make that 1790.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
They don't have any shit.
All right, where is he?
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Is morally, ethic'ly
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
I don't believe you!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Hickory!
Catch him, you fool!
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Oh, now?
Oh --
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Did you say something?
...Oh, did that hurt?
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
You've had plenty of time already!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
You're right -- I am a coward.
Hah!
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Here -- here --
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Don't you start it, too!
Somebody pulled my tail.
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Yes, you.
Oh, scared, huh?
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Hold still - hold still --
Whozat?
Not nohow!
I want to see you and your wife right away....
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhhhh!
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
Yeah --
Yes.
Well, I --
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Made to look just like an accident.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
We cant.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
I took the initiative.
The worm on the hook again.
Indeed.
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
What are you talking about?
You can drop the act, its over.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
What class sub does your nephew run?
Is it?
What do you think?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Marvellous.
Why?  What's the problem?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
The south pole.  Times flowing backwards.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
The missing scientists.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
What is this place?
Looks like a diner.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
Naturally.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
What's that?
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
What's the deal?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
... until he found tungsten.
It's too far.
What if they're naughty?
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
How?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
I know.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Oh, shit.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
I did, sir.
MMMmmmm.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
MMmmm.
You have your tickets?
Does that mean you love me?
All right then!
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
A week.  Ten days at most.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
There wolf!  There castle!
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Just putting up some tea.
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
I want that brain.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Wait till he sees the bill.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
That sound good, boss.
... It's.
Oh, just a little.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think so.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
I'm explaining my reasons.
Certainly, Sin
Which one?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
